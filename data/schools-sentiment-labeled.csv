<p>MANILA, Philippines – More than 400 Christians gathered at Bantayog ng mga Bayani, a <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/women-bantayog-bayani-museum-were-not-ready-lies/"">memorial for victims</a> of the Marcos dictatorship, to celebrate the resurrection of Christ in the face of the Philippines’ problems under the second Marcos presidency.</p>



<p>The 61-year-old National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP), the largest alliance of Christian churches in this predominantly Catholic country, held its 75th Ecumenical Easter Sunrise Service at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani from 4:30 to 7 am on Easter Sunday, March 31.</p>



<p>In this Easter service, various prayer leaders took turns in praying to the “God of freedom” for “genuine justice and peace,” for the safety of Filipino fishermen in the face of China’s bullying in the West Philippine Sea, and for assistance to migrants and workers.</p>



<p>The prayers at the ecumenical service also sought to uphold the rights of indigenous people and cultural communities against “exploitative and oppressive systems,” to defend women “amid patriarchy and a feudal system,” and to open the eyes of Christians to “the realities of our LGBTQIA+ community.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>NCCP, known for its activist stance, is at the forefront of fighting government abuses, such as the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. This comes at a steep price: its members <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/244252-red-tagged-oxfam-nccp-slam-military/"">have been red-tagged</a>.</p>

<p>“Talking about Jesus’ Lordship is about challenging the powers that are lording over us,” said NCCP chairperson Bishop Melzar Labuntog in his homily on Sunday.</p>



<p>Labuntog, who is also the general secretary of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, noted how Jesus “was killed because of His passion for a different kind of world.” In this world, he said, “the good news is proclaimed to the poor,” and there is freedom for prisoners and the oppressed, and recovery of sight to the blind.</p>



<p>“To declare that Jesus is alive means that the hungry are given food, the homeless are being sheltered, the poor are being cared for,” Labuntog said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-resurrection-is-hope"">&#8216;Resurrection is hope&#8217;</h5>



<p>In an interview with Rappler, Labuntog said it was significant that the NCCP was holding its Easter service at Bantayog ng mga Bayani because it memorializes “heroes of the faith who have given their lives for a very worthy cause” during the Marcos dictatorship.</p>



<p>Labuntog said that under the dictator’s son, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the nation’s problems still include poverty, low wages, and high prices of goods. Churches should stay involved in social issues like these because “God is involved in the lives of the people.”</p>

<p>Also explaining why the NCCP chose to celebrate Easter at Bantayog ng mga Bayani, NCCP general secretary Minnie Anne Mata-Calub said that former NCCP members – such as their former general secretary, peace advocate Bishop La Verne Mercado – are among the names on the Bantayog wall of remembrance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ambience of the Bantayog helps explain what Easter means for Christian churches, she added.</p>



<p>“Easter, as the resurrection of Jesus Christ, also gives hope that in the middle of all the chaos and problems in our society, there is hope – because resurrection is hope for us,” she told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Gay Manodon, deacon of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, also said Easter means hope – which is important in the fight against amending the country’s Constitution. “Imagine giving 100% ownership of our land, communications, and education to foreigners,” she said in a mix of English and Filipino. “There is hope that this will not happen.”</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-they-want-to-tell-marcos"">What they want to tell Marcos</h5>



<p>Bishop Dindo Ranojo, general secretary of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente or the Aglipayan Church, said in a separate interview that churches should not keep quiet on social problems, and should instead serve as “modern prophets” who give hope to people. </p>

<p>When asked about the biggest challenges under the Marcos presidency, Ranojo said in Filipino: “First, we need to continue the peace talks, fight for the West Philippine Sea, boost our agriculture, and look after the welfare of citizens, workers, farmers, and most of all the indigenous people… because the environment is our capital for our a better future.”</p>



<p>If given an opportunity to speak with Marcos, Ranojo said: “First, he should listen to the voice of the people. Second, he should pay attention to what is really happening and remedy the problems of our society.”</p>



<p>Bishop Rex Reyes of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines said that Christ “is understood from a prophetic standpoint” by the NCCP. “You challenge the status quo, and the essence of Easter sunrise is to galvanize that mobilization,” Reyes said.</p>



<p>Rappler asked Reyes, like Ranojo, about his message to Marcos if he gets the chance to address the President.</p>



<p>“<em>Ay naku</em> (Oh my gosh), I wouldn’t know how to address that guy,” said Reyes, who was a high school student when the President’s father declared Martial Law. “Until this time, I am still reeling from the impact of that rule.”</p>



<p>Reyes noted how the President “comes out with things that are similar to what his dad used,” like his slogan “Bagong Pilipinas” (New Philippines), which is similar to the “Bagong Lipunan” (New Society) of the Martial Law years. He also cited the President’s <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-jr-approves-masagana-rice-industry-development-program-targets-self-sufficiency-2028/"">own version of his father’s Masagana 99</a> for boosting agriculture. “What the heck,” the bishop said.</p>



<p>“I would think twice about addressing him. I don’t like to talk to him,” Reyes said.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the interview, he pointed to the black marble walls where the names of Martial Law victims are inscribed at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani. “The fact that we celebrate this observance amid those great names there, is very important for me,” he added.</p>



<p>“Those are heroes. Those are not just names,” the bishop said. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p class=""has-drop-cap has-text-align-left"">On October 29, 2023, a 45-year-old American named Joshua Farinella flew into the city of Amalapuram near India’s eastern coast to start his new job as the general manager at a shrimp processing plant. Surrounded by a seven-foot-high concrete wall, the plant, leased by a company called Choice Canning, was about six miles northeast of the city. Security guards patrolled the perimeter. Inside was an eight-acre compound where shrimp, cultivated in nearby ponds, were processed and shipped abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, India has exploded as the dominant source of shrimp for much of the world. In 2015, reporters found trafficked Burmese migrants held in slave-like conditions in shrimp peeling sheds in Thailand, a country that for much of the prior decade had been the preferred supplier for major Western supermarkets. Some of these food companies cut ties and imports from Thailand dropped. </p>



<p>India helped fill the void, with support from its government through subsidies and loosened foreign investment restrictions. By 2021, India exported more than $5 billion of shrimp globally and was responsible for nearly a quarter of the world’s shrimp exports. Choice Canning is one of the largest Indian suppliers in the market, with corporate offices in two big Indian cities, Kochi and Chennai, as well as in Jersey City, N.J.</p>



<p>When he arrived at the Amalapuram plant, Farinella was struck by the number of workers streaming through the gate. On any given day, there might be more than 650 workers at the plant, typically hired by third-party contractors. Hundreds of the workers lived locally in Andhra Pradesh and went home at the end of each day. The rest were migrant workers who lived at the plant, mostly women who were recruited from impoverished corners of the country. They slept in spartan dormitories on-site in metal bunk beds. A security guard was usually posted outside near the building’s front door.</p>



<p>Farinella was raised in a former mining town in Pennsylvania, and had gone off the rails as a young man, living on the street temporarily and picking up convictions including for drunk driving and trying to cash false checks. He had worked in the food industry since 2015.&nbsp;Choice Canning made frozen meals in his hometown and gave him a job as a quality-assurance officer, overseeing food-safety rules. He then worked for another seafood company, ensuring its supply chain complied with regulations, before returning to his old firm in 2023. He was used to gaps in accounting and flaws in audits. But the problems he was now exposed at the Choice Canning plant in India seemed much more serious.</p>

Choice Canning’s shrimp processing plant in Amalapuram, India, sits on an eight-acre, walled-in plot of land, surrounded by thick jungle.

<p>Soon after he started the new job, Farinella found himself having to cover up overcrowding by making plans to hide workers when inspectors came around. He was also pressured to mislead customers about the provenance and quality of their shrimp, including its certification status or farm origin, and was told to send off consignments of antibiotic-laden shrimp to America. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration bans the use of such drugs in shrimp.) </p>



<p>“I have been fighting this from afar for years,” he later said, referring to his time in food safety and quality assurance. “Then I find myself right in the middle of it. Not just in the middle of it, but it was literally my job to make all of the fucked up things keep happening.”</p>



<p>Within two weeks, things came to a head for Farinella. At 3 am on November 11, 2023, a manager sent a WhatsApp message informing him that a woman had been found running through the plant’s water treatment facility. “She was searching for a way out of here,” the manager wrote. “Her contractor is not allowing her to go home.” The woman made it as far as the main gate but was turned back by guards.</p>



<p>Forbidding workers to leave their plants when they choose to is a violation of the Indian constitution and also likely violates the country’s penal code, according to the Corporate Accountability Lab, an advocacy and research group. When Farinella arrived at the plant, several hours later, he tried to get an answer about what had been going on – and was told by an HR manager that it had all been a misunderstanding. The woman had not wanted to leave after all. An alarm bell went off in Farinella’s mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Farinella would soon decide he could not continue with Choice Canning, but, torn about what he had witnessed, he chose to collect documents, including spreadsheets of worker headcounts and wages, product tracking records, text messages on WhatsApp, e-mails and recorded phone conversations.</p>



<p>In response to a detailed set of questions about Choice Canning&#8217;s business, labor and safety practices, a lawyer for the company wrote that it categorically denies the allegations made by Farinella, whom it said should not be trusted due to his criminal record.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The company also said that documents from Mr. Farinella had been manipulated. (Upon request, a private firm that specializes in forensic data analysis reviewed a selection of the documents, including those specifically cited by Choice Canning, and they verified that they were not manipulated in any way.)</p>



<p>“Today, Choice’s mission remains the same since its founding: an unwavering commitment to providing a wholesome dining experience to all – right from the comfort of home,” the company’s statement said.</p>



<p>In January of this year, less than three months after starting his job at the plant, Farinella contacted The Outlaw Ocean Project and handed over the information he had gathered. “I think it is likely that I was hired not to manage the facility, but to be the American face that provides the appearance of legitimacy,” he said. “I’m afraid I can’t be that face.”</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator aligncenter has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots""/>



<p>“Ship it,” the WhatsApp message read.</p>



<p>This was surprising, even by the standards Farinella had come to expect at Amalapuram. His boss, Jacob Jose, the company’s vice president of sales and procurement and the son of CEO Jose Thomas, who goes by JT, had just been informed that 225 cases of raw shrimp bound for Aldi South supermarkets in the US had tested positive for antibiotics.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Much of the shrimp that India produces are raised in small aquaculture farms. The Corporate Accountability Lab found in a <a href=""https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/hidden-harvest"">report</a> released this month that many of these farms rely on antibiotics to protect the shrimp from pathogens. The widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture is leading to a rise in antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections around the world.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Farinella said he was confused to find that when the plant tested for antibiotics in the shrimp, these tests came back positive more often than he had expected. He also said the paperwork the plant used to trace shrimp to certified farms and track the presence of antibiotics was sometimes misleading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jacob Jose told him not to use the word “antibiotics” in internal communications. For shrimp that had tested positive with antibiotics, Jose asked him on WhatsApp to instead use the word “Oscar,” adding “lol.” (The company denied ever shipping antibiotic-tainted shrimp to the US and said that this exchange and the meaning of “Oscar” have been misrepresented by Farinella.)</p>



<p>Farinella said he did as he was told. “Almost 10,000 pounds of Oscar in finished packaging for Wakefern.” he wrote on WhatsApp to Jacob Jose on February 1, 2024. “What to do?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ship on one container,” the executive texted back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Off it went to America, packaged in bags marked “all natural.” (Wakefern, a US retail cooperative, did not <a href=""https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/india-shrimp-a-growing-goliath/discussion/stakeholders/wakfern-shoprite-price-rite-marketplace-gourmet-garage-and-fairway-market/"">respond</a> to requests for comment.)&nbsp;</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots""/>



<p>During his time as the plant manager, Farinella had a wide range of duties: sourcing workers and supplies of shrimp, managing finances, and making sure that plant hit its monthly production quota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Farinella struggled at first to establish how many workers lived on-site, how they were housed and fed, and how their contracts worked.

<p>Farinella said he was concerned when he found workers sleeping on the floor, but he said he and others struggled to get authorization for the necessary changes. “We need more bunk beds immediately, this cannot wait for another day please!” the plant’s vice president of human resources wrote in an email. “Existing people are facing trouble for months.”</p>

<p>A few weeks later Farinella discovered during a recorded conversation with two labor contractors for Choice Canning that 150 workers had not had a day off in a year. The contractors asked whether they could be released for an outing. Farinella approved it instantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was also hard, he said, to tell how long employees spent working. A human-resources executive admitted candidly in a Zoom meeting recorded by Farinella how she would need to adjust attendance records and timecards for an audit.</p>



<p>State law in Andhra Pradesh stipulates that workers must be paid at least 450 rupees ($5) per day. But an invoice from a labor contractor and emails between managers seemed to indicate that some workers were paid only 350 rupees a day. (The company has since <a href=""https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/india-shrimp-a-growing-goliath/discussion/stakeholders/choice-canning/"">said</a> that it always paid the minimum wage to all of its “associates” and recently even gave a raise to some of its staff.)</p>



<p>“It felt dirty,” wrote Farinella later. “I know the workers couldn’t be OK with everything there. And I also knew that every one of them probably thought I was most of, or at least part of, the problem.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December, Farinella asked Jacob Jose if workers could be paid the minimum wage. In a following email exchange with senior executives, JT declared himself “shocked” that they weren’t already. One of the executives reminded JT that he had previously told them “not to make any changes in Amalapuram for time being,” when it came to wages. (In internal emails, company managers later said they planned to raise the wages.)&nbsp;</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots""/>



<p>In January 2024, inspectors from Aldi South, a global supermarket chain, were due to visit Amalapuram to conduct a social audit checking labor conditions at the plant. While some audits are unannounced, Aldi South’s audit was scheduled in advance. Farinella met other supervisors to discuss preparations, and recorded the conversation. </p>



<p>Managers focused on what to tell auditors with regard to the number of workers at the plant. (Auditors typically check the tally of employees at a facility against wage records, available beds, and amount of workspace on the factory floor to see if there are any concerns related to underpayment or safety, according to the Corporate Accountability Lab.)</p>



<p>The managers discussed a plan to move the workers off-site before the auditors arrived. “We need to show a sizable number to them,” mused the quality-assurance officer during a recorded meeting. Eventually, the managers opted for 415 as a plausible number.</p>

<p>A few days later, in a recorded meeting, Farinella discussed the plans with a human-resources executive.</p>



<p>“So, basically,” he said, “when the auditor comes in, we&#8217;ll call them and say ‘go run away and do something else for the day.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes,” said the executive.</p>



<p>“How the hell did you come up with that idea?”</p>



<p>“Sir, JT is keeping a knife on my neck. Ideas will come.” (Aldi South <a href=""https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/india-shrimp-a-growing-goliath/discussion/stakeholders/aldi-south-group/"">said</a> it was “taking the allegations seriously” and would need more time to investigate.)</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots""/>



<p>In January, after Farinella decided to go public with what he knew, a videographer traveled to India to document conditions at the plant.

Farinella retained a lawyer and filed a formal whistleblower complaint to several US federal agencies</p>



<p>The same day, Aldi South’s auditors arrived in Amalapuram to conduct the inspections that the local managers had been discussing for weeks.

","<p>A former manager, American Joshua Farinella exposes labor and safety violations at an Indian shrimp processing plant. The company, Choice Canning, denies the allegations.</p>
",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/the-whistleblower/,2024-03-31T15:57:02,2024-03-31T16:04:51,"[763, 762, 710, 768]",The whistleblower,"   Editor's Note: This story was produced by  The Outlaw Ocean Project  .  Rappler is publishing it with permission.       On October 29, 2023, a 45-year-old American named Joshua Farinella flew into the city of Amalapuram near India's eastern coast to start his new job as the general manager at a shrimp processing plant. Surrounded by a seven-foot-high concrete wall, the plant, leased by a company called Choice Canning, was about six miles northeast of the city. Security guards patrolled the perimeter. Inside was an eight-acre compound where shrimp, cultivated in nearby ponds, were processed and shipped abroad.       In recent years, India has exploded as the dominant source of shrimp for much of the world. In 2015, reporters found trafficked Burmese migrants held in slave-like conditions in shrimp peeling sheds in Thailand, a country that for much of the prior decade had been the preferred supplier for major Western supermarkets. Some of these food companies cut ties and imports from Thailand dropped.       India helped fill the void, with support from its government through subsidies and loosened foreign investment restrictions. By 2021, India exported more than $5 billion of shrimp globally and was responsible for nearly a quarter of the world's shrimp exports. Choice Canning is one of the largest Indian suppliers in the market, with corporate offices in two big Indian cities, Kochi and Chennai, as well as in Jersey City, N.J.      When he arrived at the Amalapuram plant, Farinella was struck by the number of workers streaming through the gate. On any given day, there might be more than 650 workers at the plant, typically hired by third-party contractors. Hundreds of the workers lived locally in Andhra Pradesh and went home at the end of each day. The rest were migrant workers who lived at the plant, mostly women who were recruited from impoverished corners of the country. They slept in spartan dormitories on-site in metal bunk beds. A security guard was usually posted outside near the building's front door.      Farinella was raised in a former mining town in Pennsylvania, and had gone off the rails as a young man, living on the street temporarily and picking up convictions including for drunk driving and trying to cash false checks. He had worked in the food industry since 2015. Choice Canning made frozen meals in his hometown and gave him a job as a quality-assurance officer, overseeing food-safety rules. He then worked for another seafood company, ensuring its supply chain complied with regulations, before returning to his old firm in 2023. He was used to gaps in accounting and flaws in audits. But the problems he was now exposed at the Choice Canning plant in India seemed much more serious.        AMALAPURAM PLANT. Choice Canning's shrimp processing plant in Amalapuram, India, sits on an eight-acre, walled-in plot of land, surrounded by thick jungle. Photo by Ben Blankenship/The Outlaw Ocean Project       Soon after he started the new job, Farinella found himself having to cover up overcrowding by making plans to hide workers when inspectors came around. He was also pressured to mislead customers about the provenance and quality of their shrimp, including its certification status or farm origin, and was told to send off consignments of antibiotic-laden shrimp to America. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration bans the use of such drugs in shrimp.)       ""I have been fighting this from afar for years,"" he later said, referring to his time in food safety and quality assurance. ""Then I find myself right in the middle of it. Not just in the middle of it, but it was literally my job to make all of the fucked up things keep happening.""      Within two weeks, things came to a head for Farinella. At 3 am on November 11, 2023, a manager sent a WhatsApp message informing him that a woman had been found running through the plant's water treatment facility. ""She was searching for a way out of here,"" the manager wrote. ""Her contractor is not allowing her to go home."" The woman made it as far as the main gate but was turned back by guards.      Forbidding workers to leave their plants when they choose to is a violation of the Indian constitution and also likely violates the country's penal code, according to the Corporate Accountability Lab, an advocacy and research group. When Farinella arrived at the plant, several hours later, he tried to get an answer about what had been going on - and was told by an HR manager that it had all been a misunderstanding. The woman had not wanted to leave after all. An alarm bell went off in Farinella's mind.       Farinella would soon decide he could not continue with Choice Canning, but, torn about what he had witnessed, he chose to collect documents, including spreadsheets of worker headcounts and wages, product tracking records, text messages on WhatsApp, e-mails and recorded phone conversations.      In response to a detailed set of questions about Choice Canning's business, labor and safety practices, a lawyer for the company wrote that it categorically denies the allegations made by Farinella, whom it said should not be trusted due to his criminal record.                       Play  Video                      The company also said that documents from Mr. Farinella had been manipulated. (Upon request, a private firm that specializes in forensic data analysis reviewed a selection of the documents, including those specifically cited by Choice Canning, and they verified that they were not manipulated in any way.)      ""Today, Choice's mission remains the same since its founding: an unwavering commitment to providing a wholesome dining experience to all - right from the comfort of home,"" the company's statement said.      In January of this year, less than three months after starting his job at the plant, Farinella contacted The Outlaw Ocean Project and handed over the information he had gathered. ""I think it is likely that I was hired not to manage the facility, but to be the American face that provides the appearance of legitimacy,"" he said. ""I'm afraid I can't be that face.""           ""Ship it,"" the WhatsApp message read.      This was surprising, even by the standards Farinella had come to expect at Amalapuram. His boss, Jacob Jose, the company's vice president of sales and procurement and the son of CEO Jose Thomas, who goes by JT, had just been informed that 225 cases of raw shrimp bound for Aldi South supermarkets in the US had tested positive for antibiotics.        Much of the shrimp that India produces are raised in small aquaculture farms. The Corporate Accountability Lab found in a  report  released this month that many of these farms rely on antibiotics to protect the shrimp from pathogens. The widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture is leading to a rise in antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections around the world.           BY HAND. Women appeared to be lacking personal protective equipment such as face coverings and proper footwear peeled shrimp by hand inside an external peeling shed outside of a Choice Canning shrimp processing plant in Amalapuram, India, in January 2024. Photo by Joshua Farinella/The Outlaw Ocean Project        Farinella said he was confused to find that when the plant tested for antibiotics in the shrimp, these tests came back positive more often than he had expected. He also said the paperwork the plant used to trace shrimp to certified farms and track the presence of antibiotics was sometimes misleading.       Jacob Jose told him not to use the word ""antibiotics"" in internal communications. For shrimp that had tested positive with antibiotics, Jose asked him on WhatsApp to instead use the word ""Oscar,"" adding ""lol."" (The company denied ever shipping antibiotic-tainted shrimp to the US and said that this exchange and the meaning of ""Oscar"" have been misrepresented by Farinella.)      Farinella said he did as he was told. ""Almost 10,000 pounds of Oscar in finished packaging for Wakefern."" he wrote on WhatsApp to Jacob Jose on February 1, 2024. ""What to do?""       ""Ship on one container,"" the executive texted back.       Off it went to America, packaged in bags marked ""all natural."" (Wakefern, a US retail cooperative, did not  respond  to requests for comment.)            During his time as the plant manager, Farinella had a wide range of duties: sourcing workers and supplies of shrimp, managing finances, and making sure that plant hit its monthly production quota.       Farinella struggled at first to establish how many workers lived on-site, how they were housed and fed, and how their contracts worked. At one point he stumbled across what he called a ""hidden dormitory"" located above the ammonia compressors used for refrigeration, putting the workers in danger if there were a leak or a fire.      Farinella said he was concerned when he found workers sleeping on the floor, but he said he and others struggled to get authorization for the necessary changes. ""We need more bunk beds immediately, this cannot wait for another day please!"" the plant's vice president of human resources wrote in an email.

<p>ISTANBUL, Turkey – Turks began voting on Sunday, March 31, in municipal elections focused on President Tayyip Erdogan&#8217;s bid to reclaim control of Istanbul from rival Ekrem Imamoglu, who aims to reassert the opposition as a political force after bitter election defeats last year.</p>



<p>Istanbul Mayor Imamoglu dealt&nbsp;Erdogan&nbsp;and his AK Party the biggest electoral blow of two decades in power with his win in the 2019 vote. The president struck back in 2023 by securing re-election and a parliament majority with his nationalist allies.</p>



<p>Sunday&#8217;s results could now reinforce Erdogan&#8217;s control of NATO-member Turkey, or signal change in the major emerging economy&#8217;s divided political landscape. An Imamoglu win is seen fuelling expectations of him becoming a future national leader.</p>



<p>Polling stations opened at 7 am in eastern Turkey and elsewhere at 8 am, with more than 61 million people registered to vote. Voting ends at 5 pm and initial results are expected by 10 pm. </p>



<p>&#8220;The AK Party has completed very important projects for the development of this country,&#8221; said 28-year-old Faruk Baran after voting in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir. &#8220;(It) needs to be strong at the&nbsp;local&nbsp;level in order to continue its services.&#8221;</p>



<p>In Istanbul, a city of 16 million people that drives Turkey&#8217;s economy, polls suggest a tight race as Imamoglu&nbsp;faces a challenge from AKP candidate Murat Kurum, a former minister.</p>



<p>The results are likely to be shaped in part by economic woes driven by rampant inflation near 70%, and by Kurdish and Islamist voters weighing up the government&#8217;s performance and their hopes for political change.</p>



<p>While the main prize for&nbsp;Erdogan&nbsp;is Istanbul, he also seeks to win back the capital Ankara. Both cities were won by the opposition in 2019 after being under the rule of his AKP and Islamist predecessors for the previous 25 years.</p>



<p>Erdogan&#8217;s prospects have been helped by the collapse of the opposition alliance that he defeated last year, though Imamoglu still appeals to voters beyond his main opposition Republican People&#8217;s Party.</p>



<p>Voters of the main pro-Kurdish party were crucial to Imamoglu&#8217;s 2019 success. Their DEM party this time is fielding its own candidate in Istanbul, but many Kurds are expected to put aside party loyalty and vote for him again.</p>



<p>In the mainly Kurdish southeast, DEM is looking to reaffirm its strength after the state&nbsp;replaced pro-Kurdish party mayors&nbsp;with state-appointed &#8216;trustees&#8217; following&nbsp;previous&nbsp;elections&nbsp;over alleged ties to militants.</p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – As China continues to bully the Philippines in the West Philippine Sea, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed an executive order strengthening the country’s maritime security</p>



<p>According to Executive Order No. 57, released by the Presidential Communications Office on Sunday, March 31, the President ordered the bolstering of the country&#8217;s maritime security because the country &#8220;continues to confront a range of serious challenges that threaten not only the country&#8217;s territorial integrity, but also the peaceful existence of Filipinos, including their fundamental right to live in peace and freedom, free from fear of violence and threat.&#8221;</p>



<p>Under EO 57, the National Coast Watch Council (NCWC) was renamed and reorganized into the National Maritime Council (NMC) chaired by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin. </p>



<p>The Philippines has sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea. It has the exclusive right to exploit and take care of resources in those areas. But China claims practically all of the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, ignoring a 2016 Arbitral Ruling that deemed that claim invalid<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, which is responsible for synchronizing and operationalizing the employment of the capabilities of different government agencies to achieve unified action in the West Philippine Sea, is attached to the council.</p>



<p>The council will be the &#8220;central body in-charge of formulating policies and strategies to ensure a unified, coordinated and effective governance framework for the country&#8217;s maritime security and domain awareness.&#8221;</p>



<p>The council has the following functions:</p>

2628423,watchdogs-mouthpieces-public-relations-redefines-news-coverage-cagayan-de-oro,From watchdogs to mouthpieces: PR redefines news coverage in Cagayan de Oro,"
<p class=""has-drop-cap"">CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Communications consultants and political strategists here are now defining how news is covered by the community press, putting local politicians in a better position to push their narratives and agenda.</p>



<p>Former journalist and now public relations practitioner Bencyrus Ellorin said their work had at times become boring after <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/closure-job-cuts-covid-19-effects-local-journalism/"">social media boxed out the community press</a> in influencing the community.</p>



<p>Ellorin, a communications consultant of Cagayan de Oro Mayor Rolando &#8220;Klarex&#8221; Uy, said PR agents, through press releases and <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/social-media-multiple-edged-sword-community-journalists/"">social media campaigns</a>, now control at least 90% of how the local government is covered.</p>



<p>He said the press’ watchdog role has been largely diluted and the community press – especially local newspapers which have over the years seen their sources of revenue dry up – has become press release-dependent and polarized into competing political interests.</p>



<p>Journalists usually pick up some portions of their stories from press releases. By nature, press releases are framed through the perspective of clients who commissioned them and are, therefore, largely propaganda material. Because of this, most journalists often use PRs only to get official statements which are then verified and validated with other sources.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-hook-line-and-sinker"">Hook, line, and sinker</h5>



<p>But this is no longer the case, according to Ellorin who said he now sees journalists, especially print journalists, taking their spins hook, line, and sinker most of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this sense, the Cagayan de Oro City information office (CIO), the communications arm of the local government, as well as the different communications departments of various government agencies, are now functioning more as news outlets instead of just sources of news, he said.</p>



<p><em>“Mas kapoy ang trabaho sa PR kay kabalo ka naman nga I-print word for word so maghimo ka daghan version</em> (The PR’s job now is more tiring because you have to make many versions because you know it gets printed word for word),” he said.</p>



<p>Ellorin said there has, on the part of politicians, always been a conscious effort to influence the news agenda but the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/social-media-breeds-spreads-contempt-of-community-journalists/"">dominance of social media </a>and problems in the community press have made it easier for them to push their clients’ narratives.</p>



<p>Ellorin said the PR industry has also indirectly benefited from the lack of opportunities in the media industry. He said hiring people with journalism backgrounds is a plus factor because journalists already possess good communication skills essential in PR work.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Atrocious conditions</h5>



<p>It matters, too, that PR work, including those in government, pays way better than journalism.</p>



<p>Journalists have always struggled with low pay and lack of benefits, a condition belabored by a March 2021 survey made by the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP).</p>



<p>The NUJP is an organization of journalists with chapters all over the country, including Cagayan de Oro City.</p>



<p>According to the <a href=""https://nujp.org/state-of-media-2021-coming-together-under-crisis-conditions/"">NUJP survey</a> of more than 200 respondents in March 2021, 44% of journalists and media workers receive a monthly salary of P15,000 and below. About 15%, mostly journalists based in the provinces, get P5,000 and below.</p>



<p>Half of the respondents of the NUJP survey said they are not entitled to holiday pay, hazard pay, and insurance, even when given dangerous assignments out of town.</p>



<p>The survey results also showed 55% of the respondents saying they were not given overtime pay and nearly 40% do not have health cards.</p>



<p>Given these atrocious conditions, it is not surprising that many journalists leave the industry. A former journalist who now does PR full time said he used to take home about P50,000 as an editor in one of the now defunct regional newspapers. His previous income now comprises only 30% of what he earns through PR work.</p>



<p>Also among those who left journalism for better pay is Abigail Malalis who is now a CIO staff member. </p>



<p>Malalis said she left journalism in 2013 because her salary as a local reporter was no longer sufficient to cope with the rising costs of living. She said she now earns about four times what she used to as a reporter. She had worked for more than 10 years as a local reporter.</p>



<p>Malalis is one of four former journalists who now work for the CIO. Six other former and part-time reporters and broadcasters are with other city hall departments or are serving as consultants of the city government. </p>



<p>Three others are now with regional offices of government agencies such as the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), PhilHealth, and the Bureau of Customs (BoC).</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">For maintenance medicines</h5>



<p>Meanwhile, a practicing journalist who moonlights as a consultant of the city government said he does so to augment his income.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted to receiving P21,000 a month from city hall as a communications consultant. As editor-reporter of one of the city’s publications, he makes about P15,000 a month.</p>



<p><em>“Pang maintenance lang gud kay apikhan gud kaayo ko ron </em>(I did that for my maintenance medicines because I am on a tight budget right now),” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journalist has been in and out of hospitals of late because of a medical condition, and colleagues have had to pitch in and help, a common occurrence when journalists get into unexpected, financially draining circumstances.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Better press releases</h5>



<p>Former journalists with communications skills honed by years of journalistic practice have certainly contributed to making better press releases for the city government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ellorin said the PRs they now put out read like news stories – well-written and with coherent narratives, ready for publication. He added that nine out of 10 press releases they produce appear in community newspapers with barely any changes. These are then often picked up and amplified by others in the community press.</p>



<p>Cagayan de Oro City’s media community is composed of two community newspapers, at least five weeklies, and some 20 AM and FM stations.</p>



<p><em>“Nahimo na gyud ping-pong table ang media </em>(The media has become like a ping-pong table),” said Ellorin, adding that political opponents of his client employ PR agents too.</p>



<p>Aside from hiring PR agents, politicians often also buy “blocktime” or airtime on radio, and have their programs streamed online, often with journalists or former journalists serving as hosts and co-hosts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Former Cagayan de Oro mayor Oscar Moreno has his <em>Overtime with Oca Moreno</em>, with some 48,000 followers on Facebook. Uy, Moreno’s successor, has <em>Inyong Alagad, Mayor Rolando &#8220;Klarex&#8221; Uy</em>, which airs both on Magnum Radio 99.9 and through Facebook Live. Former Misamis Oriental governor and now the province’s 2nd District Representative, Yevgeny Vincente Emano, and incumbent Governor Peter Unabia have similar radio programs.</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Changing landscape</h5>



<p>It was not always this way. As late as five years ago, the city had three local dailies – <em>Mindanao Gold Star Daily, SunStar-Cagayan de Oro, </em>and <em>Mindanao Daily,</em> aside from a host of weeklies that covered and commented on the local political scene.</p>



<p>But elsewhere worldwide, this all changed as more and more people turned to social media not only for entertainment or for socializing with family and friends, but also for information and news.</p>



<p>Local newspapers, many of which only had marginal profitability in the first place, became especially vulnerable to the prospect of closure or downsizing as tech giants like Google and Meta began cornering even local revenue streams.</p>



<p>Among the first to fold due to declining revenues was <em>SunStar-Cagayan de Oro</em>, which shuttered its print edition on June 30, 2020. The community newspaper, a local affiliate of the Cebu-based SunStar group of community newspapers, had long struggled with profitability issues before repeated COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns forced it to cease print operations.</p>



<p><em>SunStar-Cagayan de Oro</em> at one point employed some 25 editors, reporters, and other media workers.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1535"" height=""1040"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/CDO-press4.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2628461"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/CDO-press4.jpg?resize=1535%2C1040&amp;zoom=1 1535w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/CDO-press4.jpg?resize=1535%2C1040&amp;zoom=0.5 768w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/CDO-press4.jpg?resize=1535%2C1040&amp;zoom=0.25 384w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1535px) 100vw, 1535px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">OLD NEWSROOM.A newsroom in Cagayan de Oro in the 1990s. from Terry Betonio FB page</figcaption></figure>



<p>Established in 1995, <em>SunStar-Cagayan de Oro</em> was unique in the local media landscape as it was the only community newspaper then that employed the most number of full-time staff members. Because full-time employment, especially in the community press, had always been rare and often, newspapers would source their content from freelancers or correspondents who were paid per story published.</p>



<p>To augment their incomes, journalists from many community newspapers are allowed or even encouraged by media owners to solicit ads so they can earn commissions. Local politicians, heads of regional government offices, and local businesses often not only become news sources, but sources of income as well.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Still holding on</h5>



<p>Meanwhile, the remaining dailies in the city that have managed to survive have drastically scaled down operations.</p>



<p>Cong Corrales, editor-in-chief of the <em>Mindanao Gold Star Daily,</em> said the paper had a daily circulation of some 60,000 copies 10 years ago. Now his newspaper prints about 2,000, and only when ads warrant the printing of copies. <em>Gold Star</em> still publishes daily online, however.</p>



<p>When the pandemic struck, Corrales said, they had to whittle down the newspaper to the bare bones.</p>



<p>“Shrinking workforces mean more work for those who remain and less time spent per story,” Corrales said.</p>

<p>This is also part of the reason why, he said, well-written stories crafted by former journalists are finding their way to the pages not just of his newspaper, but also in others.</p>



<p>Corrales, however, said that while he uses press releases 80% of the time, he makes sure to label them as such for transparency.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Influence and control</h5>



<p>Former journalist Carlos Conde, who was <em>SunStar-Cagayan de Oro’s</em> first editor-in-chief and who is now a senior researcher at the Asia division of Human Rights Watch (HRW) covering the Philippines, said he is not surprised that politicians and other interest groups find it easy to influence or, worse, control Cagayan de Oro’s media outfits.</p>



<p>“They’ve been doing it for decades and the advent of social media made things a lot easier for them to do this: today, they not only control the media by the traditional means – they are able to directly control the narrative and push their propaganda and agenda almost unfiltered by the press,” Conde said.</p>



<p>However, Conde said that the prevalence of press releases dominating the content of media outlets is true elsewhere, not just in Cagayan de Oro.</p>



<p>“If you are a media outlet or journalist struggling to make ends meet, your options to do honest, meaningful journalism work is severely limited,” Conde said.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1080"" height=""690"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/CDO-press2.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2628459"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/CDO-press2.jpg?resize=1080%2C690&amp;zoom=1 1080w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/CDO-press2.jpg?resize=1080%2C690&amp;zoom=0.5 540w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/CDO-press2.jpg?resize=1080%2C690&amp;zoom=0.25 270w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">ASSEMBLY.

<p>The influence of PRs shaping the news narrative is a concern for Luz Rimban, a journalism educator at the Ateneo de Manila University and the executive director of the Asian Center for Journalism, both located at Ateneo.</p>



<p>“PR people don&#8217;t really tell you the real story. They exist to make their clients look good. In fact, some studies have shown that it is the bad actors in the PR industry that are responsible for disinformation on social media,” Rimban said in an e-mail to Rappler.</p>



<p>“The audience needs to be aware of the motives and agenda of sources of their stories. A government official owning a news outlet or having a social media account? Social media users should be aware that politicians are there on social media (or their own news outlets) more for self-promotion. They&#8217;re trying to influence the news agenda so that their misdeeds and wrongdoing are kept hidden,” Rimban said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Polarization</h5>



<p>The effect of PR-dominated reportage has severely polarized the community media into rival political camps with directly opposing narratives.</p>



<p>Maricel Casino-Rivera, who ran the city hall’s information office during the Moreno administration, said this doesn’t seem to bother many local journalists these days.</p>



<p><em>“Dili parehas sa una nga mahadlok pud bitaw ta nga ma brand ta nga tao ni so-and-so </em>(Unlike before when journalists did not like being branded as lackeys of certain politicians),” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Rivera, who worked for years as a journalist before joining Moreno’s group, said the media should revisit its role as a watchdog, as well as seize social media space, to continue to remain relevant.</p>



<p>Veteran journalist Froilan Gallardo, the new president of the Cagayan de Oro Press Club (COPC), called on the city’s journalists to maintain their independence from interest groups, especially politicians.</p>



<p>During the COPC’s 73rd induction of officers on March 17, Gallardo said, “We cannot rely on dole-outs and remain at the mercy of the politicians. If we continue doing that, we – the industry itself – would become irrelevant and eventually lose the game [because] the public would know that we are (sic) already bought and [have] become mouthpieces of every politician.”</p>



<p>The local press club, which counts 100 members from the broadcast, print, and online media, is the oldest and premier news media organization in the city.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">‘Easier said than done’</h5>



<p>The poor state of the media is making even those aspiring to become journalists think twice.</p>



<p>For instance, graduating Development Communications students Anthony Fornillos and Neil Culta said they were considering careers in journalism, but that salary is a major concern.</p>



<p><em>“Mangitag asa makapanginabuhi nga makabuhi jud</em> (I’ll look for a job that can provide decent income), Fornillos said.</p>



<p>Dr. Shiella Balbutin, an assistant professor at Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan&#8217;s Department of Development Communication, said the local media appears to be losing their influence on the community such that interest groups now dominate public discourse.</p>



<p>&#8220;If this continues, it can lead to biased information dissemination and will prevent participatory dialogue from happening,&#8221; Balbutin said.

",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/watchdogs-mouthpieces-public-relations-redefines-news-coverage-cagayan-de-oro/,2024-03-30T19:55:46,2024-03-30T19:55:52,"[16490, 709, 702, 20536, 696]",From watchdogs to mouthpieces: PR redefines news coverage in Cagayan de Oro,"  CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines - Communications consultants and political strategists here are now defining how news is covered by the community press, putting local politicians in a better position to push their narratives and agenda.      Former journalist and now public relations practitioner Bencyrus Ellorin said their work had at times become boring after  social media boxed out the community press  in influencing the community.      Ellorin, a communications consultant of Cagayan de Oro Mayor Rolando ""Klarex"" Uy, said PR agents, through press releases and  social media campaigns , now control at least 90% of how the local government is covered.      He said the press' watchdog role has been largely diluted and the community press - especially local newspapers which have over the years seen their sources of revenue dry up - has become press release-dependent and polarized into competing political interests.      Journalists usually pick up some portions of their stories from press releases. By nature, press releases are framed through the perspective of clients who commissioned them and are, therefore, largely propaganda material. Because of this, most journalists often use PRs only to get official statements which are then verified and validated with other sources.      Hook, line, and sinker      But this is no longer the case, according to Ellorin who said he now sees journalists, especially print journalists, taking their spins hook, line, and sinker most of the time.       In this sense, the Cagayan de Oro City information office (CIO), the communications arm of the local government, as well as the different communications departments of various government agencies, are now functioning more as news outlets instead of just sources of news, he said.       ""Mas kapoy ang trabaho sa PR kay kabalo ka naman nga I-print word for word so maghimo ka daghan version  (The PR's job now is more tiring because you have to make many versions because you know it gets printed word for word),"" he said.      Ellorin said there has, on the part of politicians, always been a conscious effort to influence the news agenda but the  dominance of social media  and problems in the community press have made it easier for them to push their clients' narratives.      Ellorin said the PR industry has also indirectly benefited from the lack of opportunities in the media industry. He said hiring people with journalism backgrounds is a plus factor because journalists already possess good communication skills essential in PR work.      Atrocious conditions      It matters, too, that PR work, including those in government, pays way better than journalism.      Journalists have always struggled with low pay and lack of benefits, a condition belabored by a March 2021 survey made by the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP).      The NUJP is an organization of journalists with chapters all over the country, including Cagayan de Oro City.      According to the  NUJP survey  of more than 200 respondents in March 2021, 44% of journalists and media workers receive a monthly salary of P15,000 and below. About 15%, mostly journalists based in the provinces, get P5,000 and below.      Half of the respondents of the NUJP survey said they are not entitled to holiday pay, hazard pay, and insurance, even when given dangerous assignments out of town.      The survey results also showed 55% of the respondents saying they were not given overtime pay and nearly 40% do not have health cards.      Given these atrocious conditions, it is not surprising that many journalists leave the industry. A former journalist who now does PR full time said he used to take home about P50,000 as an editor in one of the now defunct regional newspapers. His previous income now comprises only 30% of what he earns through PR work.      Also among those who left journalism for better pay is Abigail Malalis who is now a CIO staff member.       Malalis said she left journalism in 2013 because her salary as a local reporter was no longer sufficient to cope with the rising costs of living. She said she now earns about four times what she used to as a reporter. She had worked for more than 10 years as a local reporter.      Malalis is one of four former journalists who now work for the CIO. Six other former and part-time reporters and broadcasters are with other city hall departments or are serving as consultants of the city government.       Three others are now with regional offices of government agencies such as the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), PhilHealth, and the Bureau of Customs (BoC).      For maintenance medicines      Meanwhile, a practicing journalist who moonlights as a consultant of the city government said he does so to augment his income.       The journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted to receiving P21,000 a month from city hall as a communications consultant. As editor-reporter of one of the city's publications, he makes about P15,000 a month.       ""Pang maintenance lang gud kay apikhan gud kaayo ko ron  (I did that for my maintenance medicines because I am on a tight budget right now),"" he said.       The journalist has been in and out of hospitals of late because of a medical condition, and colleagues have had to pitch in and help, a common occurrence when journalists get into unexpected, financially draining circumstances.      Better press releases      Former journalists with communications skills honed by years of journalistic practice have certainly contributed to making better press releases for the city government.       Ellorin said the PRs they now put out read like news stories - well-written and with coherent narratives, ready for publication. He added that nine out of 10 press releases they produce appear in community newspapers with barely any changes. These are then often picked up and amplified by others in the community press.      Cagayan de Oro City's media community is composed of two community newspapers, at least five weeklies, and some 20 AM and FM stations.       ""Nahimo na gyud ping-pong table ang media  (The media has become like a ping-pong table),"" said Ellorin, adding that political opponents of his client employ PR agents too.      Aside from hiring PR agents, politicians often also buy ""blocktime"" or airtime on radio, and have their programs streamed online, often with journalists or former journalists serving as hosts and co-hosts.       Former Cagayan de Oro mayor Oscar Moreno has his  Overtime with Oca Moreno , with some 48,000 followers on Facebook. Uy, Moreno's successor, has  Inyong Alagad, Mayor Rolando ""Klarex"" Uy , which airs both on Magnum Radio 99.9 and through Facebook Live. Former Misamis Oriental governor and now the province's 2nd District Representative, Yevgeny Vincente Emano, and incumbent Governor Peter Unabia have similar radio programs.          ""CDO will have water with or without COBI,"" says Oro Mayor Klarex Uy            Changing landscape      It was not always this way. As late as five years ago, the city had three local dailies -  Mindanao Gold Star Daily, SunStar-Cagayan de Oro,  and  Mindanao Daily,  aside from a host of weeklies that covered and commented on the local political scene.      But elsewhere worldwide, this all changed as more and more people turned to social media not only for entertainment or for socializing with family and friends, but also for information and news.      Local newspapers, many of which only had marginal profitability in the first place, became especially vulnerable to the prospect of closure or downsizing as tech giants like Google and Meta began cornering even local revenue streams.      Among the first to fold due to declining revenues was  SunStar-Cagayan de Oro , which shuttered its print edition on June 30, 2020. The community newspaper, a local affiliate of the Cebu-based SunStar group of community newspapers, had long struggled with profitability issues before repeated COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns forced it to cease print operations.       SunStar-Cagayan de Oro  at one point employed some 25 editors, reporters, and other media workers.        OLD NEWSROOM.A newsroom in Cagayan de Oro in the 1990s. from Terry Betonio FB page       Established in 1995,  SunStar-Cagayan de Oro  was unique in the local media landscape as it was the only community newspaper then that employed the most number of full-time staff members. Because full-time employment, especially in the community press, had always been rare and often, newspapers would source their content from freelancers or correspondents who were paid per story published.      To augment their incomes, journalists from many community newspapers are allowed or even encouraged by media owners to solicit ads so they can earn commissions. Local politicians, heads of regional government offices, and local businesses often not only become news sources, but sources of income as well.      Still holding on      Meanwhile, the remaining dailies in the city that have managed to survive have drastically scaled down operations.      Cong Corrales, editor-in-chief of the  Mindanao Gold Star Daily,  said the paper had a daily circulation of some 60,000 copies 10 years ago. Now his newspaper prints about 2,000, and only when ads warrant the printing of copies.  Gold Star  still publishes daily online, however.      When the pandemic struck, Corrales said, they had to whittle down the newspaper to the bare bones.      ""Shrinking workforces mean more work for those who remain and less time spent per story,"" Corrales said.        '90S NEWSROOM. The staff of the now-defunct SunStar-Cagayan de Oro in the mid-1990s. Courtesy of Joey Nacalaban       This is also part of the reason why, he said, well-written stories crafted by former journalists are finding their way to the pages not just of his newspaper, but also in others.      Corrales, however, said that while he uses press releases 80% of the time, he makes sure to label them as such for transparency.      Influence and control      Former journalist Carlos Conde, who was  SunStar-Cagayan de Oro's  first editor-in-chief and who is now a senior researcher at the Asia division of Human Rights Watch (HRW) covering the Philippines, said he is not surprised that politicians and other interest groups find it easy to influence or, worse, control Cagayan de Oro's media outfits.      ""They've been doing it for decades and the advent of social media made things a lot easier for them to do this: today, they not only control the media by the traditional means - they are able to directly control the narrative and push their propaganda and agenda almost unfiltered by the press,"" Conde said.      However, Conde said that the prevalence of press releases dominating the content of media outlets is true elsewhere, not just in Cagayan de Oro.      ""If you are a media outlet or journalist struggling to make ends meet, your options to do honest, meaningful journalism work is severely limited,"" Conde said.        ASSEMBLY. Journalists gather during the general assembly of the Cagayan de Oro Press Club in 2023. courtesy of the Cagayan de Oro Press Club       The influence of PRs shaping the news narrative is a concern for Luz Rimban, a journalism educator at the Ateneo de Manila University and the executive director of the Asian Center for Journalism, both located at Ateneo.      ""PR people don't really tell you the real story. They exist to make their clients look good. In fact, some studies have shown that it is the bad actors in the PR industry that are responsible for disinformation on social media,"" Rimban said in an e-mail to Rappler.      ""The audience needs to be aware of the motives and agenda of sources of their stories. A government official owning a news outlet or having a social media account? Social media users should be aware that politicians are there on social media (or their own news outlets) more for self-promotion. They're trying to influence the news agenda so that their misdeeds and wrongdoing are kept hidden,"" Rimban said.      Polarization      The effect of PR-dominated reportage has severely polarized the community media into rival political camps with directly opposing narratives.      Maricel Casino-Rivera, who ran the city hall's information office during the Moreno administration, said this doesn't seem to bother many local journalists these days.       ""Dili parehas sa una nga mahadlok pud bitaw ta nga ma brand ta nga tao ni so-and-so  (Unlike before when journalists did not like being branded as lackeys of certain politicians),"" Rivera said.      Rivera, who worked for years as a journalist before joining Moreno's group, said the media should revisit its role as a watchdog, as well as seize social media space, to continue to remain relevant.      Veteran journalist Froilan Gallardo, the new president of the Cagayan de Oro Press Club (COPC), called on the city's journalists to maintain their independence from interest groups, especially politicians.      During the COPC's 73rd induction of officers on March 17, Gallardo said, ""We cannot rely on dole-outs and remain at the mercy of the politicians. If we continue doing that, we - the industry itself - would become irrelevant and eventually lose the game [because] the public would know that we are (sic) already bought and [have] become mouthpieces of every politician.""      The local press club, which counts 100 members from the broadcast, print, and online media, is the oldest and premier news media organization in the city.      'Easier said than done'      The poor state of the media is making even those aspiring to become journalists think twice.      For instance, graduating Development Communications students Anthony Fornillos and Neil Culta said they were considering careers in journalism, but that salary is a major concern.       ""Mangitag asa makapanginabuhi nga makabuhi jud  (I'll look for a job that can provide decent income), Fornillos said.      Dr. Shiella Balbutin, an assistant professor at Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan's Department of Development Communication, said the local media appears to be losing their influence on the community such that interest groups now dominate public discourse.      ""If this continues, it can lead to biased information dissemination and will prevent participatory dialogue from happening,"" Balbutin said. This is why, Balbutin said, academics need to do better at promoting critical thinking and should continue to strengthen media literacy initiatives.      Getting out of the morass of perennially regurgitating content pushed by political and other vested interest groups, however, may not be this easy.      ""As a long-time journalist myself, before I plunged into the world of human rights advocacy, I know only too well the challenges many of my colleagues and friends face these days.

<p>WASHINGTON, USA – The United States said on Friday, March 29, it will impose new visa restrictions on a number of Hong Kong officials over the crackdown on rights and freedoms in the Chinese-ruled territory.</p>



<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that in the past year China continued to take actions against Hong Kong&#8217;s promised high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and rights and freedoms, including with the recent enactment of a new national security law known as <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/what-article-23-means-future-hong-kong-once-vibrant-pro-democracy-movement/"">Article 23</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;In response, the Department of State is announcing that it is taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on multiple Hong Kong officials responsible for the intensifying crackdown on rights and freedoms,&#8221; Blinken said in a statement.</p>



<p>The statement did not identify the officials who would be targeted.</p>



<p>In November, Hong Kong condemned a US bill calling for sanctions against 49 Hong Kong officials, judges and prosecutors involved in national security cases, saying US legislators were grandstanding and trying to intimidate the city.</p>



<p>Officials named in that Hong Kong Sanctions Act included Secretary for Justice Paul Lam, Police chief Raymond Siu and judges Andrew Cheung, Andrew Chan, Johnny Chan, Alex Lee, Esther Toh and Amanda Woodcock.</p>



<p>The United States has imposed visa restrictions and other sanctions in the past on Hong Kong officials blamed for undermining freedoms and announced an end to the special economic treatment the territory long enjoyed under US law.</p>



<p>It has also warned that foreign financial institutions that conduct business with them would be subject to sanctions.</p>



<p>The US Hong Kong Policy Act requires the State Department to report each year to Congress on conditions in Hong Kong.</p>



<p>&#8220;This year, I have again certified that Hong Kong does not warrant treatment under US laws in the same manner as the laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1, 1997,&#8221; Blinken said, referring to when Hong Kong was handed back to China by Britain.</p>



<p>&#8220;This year’s report catalogs the intensifying repression and ongoing crackdown by PRC and Hong Kong authorities on civil society, media, and dissenting voices, including through the issuance of bounties and arrest warrants for more than a dozen pro-democracy activists living outside Hong Kong,&#8221; Blinken said, referring to the People&#8217;s Republic of China.</p>



<p>The Commissioner&#8217;s Office of China&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said the report and statements issued by Blinken &#8220;confused right and wrong&#8221; and &#8220;stigmatized&#8221; Hong Kong&#8217;s national security law and the city&#8217;s electoral system.</p>



<p>The threat to sanction Hong Kong officials &#8220;grossly interferes&#8221; in Hong Kong affairs and China&#8217;s internal affairs, a spokesperson said in a statement issued on Saturday, March 30.</p>



<p>&#8220;Instead of acting as the world&#8217;s policeman and issuing an annual &#8216;Hong Kong Policy Act report&#8217;, the United States should take time to examine itself.&#8221;</p>



<p>China&#8217;s embassy in Washington said it strongly deplored and firmly opposed US threats to &#8220;impose unwarranted unilateral sanctions&#8221; on Hong Kong.</p>

<p>HONG KONG –&nbsp;United States-funded&nbsp;Radio&nbsp;Free&nbsp;Asia said on Friday, March 29, it had closed its Hong Kong bureau citing concerns over staff safety after the enactment of a new national security law known as Article 23 in the China-ruled city.</p>



<p>&#8220;Actions by Hong Kong authorities, including referring to RFA as a &#8216;foreign force&#8217;, raise serious questions about our ability to operate in safety with the enactment of Article 23,&#8221; Bay Fang, its president <a href=""https://www.rfa.org/about/releases/rfa-president-hong-kong-bureau-to-restructure-in-light-of-article-23"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">said in a statement</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/what-article-23-means-future-hong-kong-once-vibrant-pro-democracy-movement/"">law</a> came into effect&nbsp;on March 23&nbsp;after it was unanimously passed by Hong Kong&#8217;s pro-Beijing legislature, updating a broader China-imposed national security law in 2020.</p>



<p>It comes with stiffer punishments from several years up to life for&nbsp;crimes including treason, sedition, state secrets, espionage and external interference.</p>



<p>Critics like the US government say the law gives authorities broader powers to clamp down on dissent. Beijing says the law is necessary to restore order to the financial hub after&nbsp;mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;spokesperson for the US State Department said &#8220;RFA’s decision represents the latest consequence of Hong Kong authorities’ continuing suppression of media&nbsp;freedom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We remain deeply concerned about the deterioration in protection for human rights and fundamental&nbsp;freedoms and the systematic dismantling of Hong Kong’s autonomy under the National Security Law and recently passed Article 23 legislation,&#8221; the official said.   </p>



<p>In a statement earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was taking steps to&nbsp;impose new visa restrictions&nbsp;on multiple Hong Kong officials over the crackdown on rights and&nbsp;freedoms.</p>



<p>The closure of RFA&#8217;s bureau and the removal of full-time staff is a sign of eroding media&nbsp;freedoms in Hong Kong, critics say,&nbsp;and reflects concerns among some businesses and entities&nbsp;with links to foreign governments that they may be vulnerable under the new laws.</p>



<p>(RFA) was &#8220;among the last independent news organizations reporting on events happening in Hong Kong in Cantonese and Mandarin,&#8221; RFA&#8217;s Fang added.</p>



<p>In recent years, liberal Hong Kong media outlets like the Apple Daily newspaper, Stand News and&nbsp;Citizens&#8217;&nbsp;Radio&nbsp;were forced to shut down under pressure from authorities.</p>



<p>The Apple Daily&#8217;s publisher and pro-democracy advocate&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-security-trial-jimmy-lai-opens-december-18-2023/"">Jimmy La</a>i, 76, is now on trial for allegedly endangering national security and publishing seditious materials – a landmark case that could see him jailed for life.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong government said in an emailed response to Reuters that it would not comment on RFA&#8217;s decision, but it &#8220;condemn(s) all scaremongering and smearing remarks.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To single out Hong Kong and suggest that journalists would only experience concerns when operating here but not in other countries would be grossly biased, if not outrageous,&#8221; it added.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, Hong Kong authorities have issued statements criticizing some international media outlets including the BBC for their reporting on the new security law, while stressing they continue to respect media&nbsp;freedoms.</p>



<p>Media rights group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Hong Kong 140th out of 180 in its annual global media&nbsp;freedom index in 2023, down from 73 before the 2020 security law.</p>



<p>In January, the Hong Kong police criticized RFA for an interview with an&nbsp;exiled activist, Ted Hui, saying it should not provide a platform for Hui to slander the police.</p>

""Actions by Hong Kong authorities, including referring to RFA as a ‘foreign force', raise serious questions about our ability to operate in safety with the enactment of Article 23,"" Bay Fang, its president  said in a statement .      The  law  came into effect on March 23 after it was unanimously passed by Hong Kong's pro-Beijing legislature, updating a broader China-imposed national security law in 2020.      It comes with stiffer punishments from several years up to life for crimes including treason, sedition, state secrets, espionage and external interference.      Critics like the US government say the law gives authorities broader powers to clamp down on dissent. Beijing says the law is necessary to restore order to the financial hub after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.      A spokesperson for the US State Department said ""RFA's decision represents the latest consequence of Hong Kong authorities' continuing suppression of media freedom.""      ""We remain deeply concerned about the deterioration in protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the systematic dismantling of Hong Kong's autonomy under the National Security Law and recently passed Article 23 legislation,"" the official said.         In a statement earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on multiple Hong Kong officials over the crackdown on rights and freedoms.      The closure of RFA's bureau and the removal of full-time staff is a sign of eroding media freedoms in Hong Kong, critics say, and reflects concerns among some businesses and entities with links to foreign governments that they may be vulnerable under the new laws.      (RFA) was ""among the last independent news organizations reporting on events happening in Hong Kong in Cantonese and Mandarin,"" RFA's Fang added.      In recent years, liberal Hong Kong media outlets like the Apple Daily newspaper, Stand News and Citizens' Radio were forced to shut down under pressure from authorities.      The Apple Daily's publisher and pro-democracy advocate  Jimmy La i, 76, is now on trial for allegedly endangering national security and publishing seditious materials - a landmark case that could see him jailed for life.      The Hong Kong government said in an emailed response to Reuters that it would not comment on RFA's decision, but it ""condemn(s) all scaremongering and smearing remarks.""      ""To single out Hong Kong and suggest that journalists would only experience concerns when operating here but not in other countries would be grossly biased, if not outrageous,"" it added.      In recent weeks, Hong Kong authorities have issued statements criticizing some international media outlets including the BBC for their reporting on the new security law, while stressing they continue to respect media freedoms.      Media rights group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Hong Kong 140th out of 180 in its annual global media freedom index in 2023, down from 73 before the 2020 security law.      In January, the Hong Kong police criticized RFA for an interview with an exiled activist, Ted Hui, saying it should not provide a platform for Hui to slander the police.      RFA had been operating its Hong Kong bureau since 1996, a year before the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule.   - Rappler.com   ",Negative

<p>GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – An old Visayan riddle goes, <em>“Kabayo ni Adan, dili mokaon kon dili kabay-an (</em>Adan’s horse, won&#8217;t eat unless you ride it).”</p>



<p>The riddle refers to a traditional Filipino household tool called by many names – <em>kaguran</em> or <em>kudkuran</em> in Mindanao and the Visayas,<em> kayuran</em> among Tagalogs, <em>pangudkuran</em> in Batanes, and <em>igad</em> or<em> pagigadan</em> among Ilocanos.</p>



<p>In English, the names simply translate to coconut grater or scraper, a wooden bench with a sharp, serrated rounded steel tip on one end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benjamin Almeda Sr., known as the &#8220;Father of Filipino inventors,&#8221; introduced the contraption to his fellow Filipinos in the early 1950s. Almeda is credited for the invention of various food processing machines that are commonly used to this day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To use the kaguran, one has to mount the bench to manually grate coconut on its rounded blade. It is  used to grate the meat of mature coconut or niyog.</p>



<p>A well known process among Filipinos and&nbsp;other&nbsp;Southeast Asians, it is done for easy extraction of coconut milk that is locally called <em>gata, </em>which is produced by squeezing the grated coconut with one&#8217;s hands. <em>Gata</em> is mixed in many Filipino dishes and delicacies.</p>



<p>“You cannot have <em>gata</em> without the <em>kaguran</em> unless you masticate the coconut,” jested retired government employee Bobby Catubig who is fond of cooking the famous <em>binignit</em>, a popular Holy Week staple that consists of sticky rice, jackfruit, tubers, and tapioca pearls cooked in coconut milk.</p>



<p>When there are festivities and important celebrations, the <em>kaguran</em> takes prominence in its role in delectable creamy food preparations.</p>



<p>During Holy Week, when most Filipinos cook popular native delicacies with coconut milk, <em>kaguran</em> or <em>igad</em> takes center stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Households without the traditional tool and rely on their neighbors&#8217; <em>kaguran</em> usually become the butt of jokes in the neighborhood.</p>



<p>A favorite anecdotal alibi of those who did not prepare food during Holy Week or Halloween is that &#8220;the neighbor failed to return their <em>kaguran&#8221;</em> or &#8220;the neighbor did not lend their <em>kaguran</em>.&#8221;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-a-vanishing-kitchen-tool"">A vanishing kitchen tool</h5>



<p>With the advent of technology, the manually-operated household grater is slowly fading from the kitchen of many Filipinos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>kaguran </em>has also become scarce in most stores. Some online shops sell it but relatively expensive at more than a thousand pesos, beyond the means of an ordinary individual.</p>



<p>Instead of buying<em> </em>a<em> kaguran</em>, many residents have resorted to having their coconuts grated by enterprising vendors who also provide motor-driven coconut grating and grain grinding services.</p>



<p>In Palawan, some shops that offer the motorized grating service retain the shell and coconut pulp to be sold as feed, retired development worker and craftsperson Aveen Acuña-Gulo told Rappler on Saturday, March 30.</p>

<p class=""has-text-align-center""><strong>First of 2 parts</strong></p>



<p class=""has-text-align-center""><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: This story is based on an original submission by Ateneo de Manila students Angeline Braganza, Allison Co, and Iana Padilla for their investigative journalism class.</em></p>



<p class=""has-drop-cap"">In October 2020, activist Reina Mae Nasino, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/moveph/groups-statements-police-presence-baby-river-nasino-burial/"">surrounded by cops</a>, wrapped up in full protective gear, and wearing handcuffs, attended her baby’s funeral.</p>



<p>Nasino and her baby River became icons of injustice, not just of the crackdown on dissent during the Duterte administration, but of the conditions of detained mothers who simply want to care for their newborn babies. Baby River was separated from Nasino at birth, and <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/baby-separated-from-jailed-activist-mother-reina-mae-nasino-dies/"">died when she was only three months old</a>.</p>



<p>“I would randomly wake up, tears welling in my eyes. And then, I would find myself embracing the last shirt my baby wore,” Nasino said in a recent interview. In 2023, she was <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/manila-court-acquits-reina-mae-nasino-others-criminal-charges-july-27-2023/"">acquitted</a> of charges pertaining to illegal possession of firearms and explosives.</p>



<p>Nasino, who spent most of her pregnancy in the Manila City Jail, is just one of the countless mothers in the Philippines who enter prison with a baby in their wombs. Over in Mandaluyong, there is a 21-square-meter room in the Correctional Institution for Women (CIW) called the mothers’ ward.</p>



<p>Here stay persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) who are pregnant, or had just given birth. The mothers’ ward consists of six beds, a shared bathroom with curtains serving as a door, a meager pantry, faded stickers of cartoon characters on the walls, and a shelf of dusty toys.</p>



<p>Maria*, 34, was once among the expectant mothers – she entered CIW eight months pregnant in September 2023. The following month, she gave birth to a baby boy. While she felt delighted to welcome this little drop of joy into her life, she couldn’t cope with the storm of financial demands that assaulted her. Maria had to borrow money from a fellow PDL to cover her ultrasound sessions, check-ups, and laboratory fees.</p>



<p>The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) has a measly <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/bureau-corrections-food-medicines-budget-prisoners-2024/"">P15-medicine budget per PDL</a>, per day. According to lone resident doctor and Corrections Technical Chief Superintendent Maria Lourdes Razon, this already accounts for everything medical –&nbsp;from medicines to medical supplies like cotton balls and alcohol, and even period products. There&#8217;s no separate budget for a PDL who is pregnant or ill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In CIW, according to Razon, PDLs who have prescription medicines have to deposit in the pharmacy whatever money is provided by their families. The pharmacy then deducts from the fund whatever medicines PDLs avail of. </p>



<p>When needed, and especially for births, CIW’s pregnant PDLs are referred to the Mandaluyong City Medical Center (MCMC), a stone’s throw from the prison. Razon claimed that the PDLs who need procedures need not shell out any money, as it is a public hospital. But such does not seem to be the case – if Maria’s experience is any indication.</p>



<p>Maria was lucky that her fellow PDL had an extra P3,000 she could spare from the money deposited in the pharmacy.</p>

A person deprived of liberty with her son. Photo by Michelle Abad/Rappler</figcaption></figure>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-inadequate-resources"">Inadequate resources</h5>



<p>A shortage of resources and medical staff compromises the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, particularly in terms of prenatal and postnatal care. This situation forces pregnant PDLs to bear the financial burden of medical expenses, as Maria herself experienced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of March 2024, the CIW has a population of around 3,100, but, according to Dr. Razon, the facility is meant to house only 1,000.</p>



<p>Besides Razon, there are only 13 nurses to tend to the over 3,000 PDLs in CIW, translating to one nurse for every 231 women, with no obstetricians, gynecologists (OB-GYN), nor midwives.</p>



<p>The CIW shares a line item with the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in the BuCor’s budget. From the <a href=""https://www.dbm.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/GAA/GAA2023/VolumeI/DOJ/B.pdf"">P5.2 billion</a> budget the NBP and CIW shared in 2023, their budget was cut down to <a href=""https://www.dbm.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/GAA/GAA2024/VolumeI/DOJ/B.pdf"">P4.72 billion</a> in 2024. But NBP likely takes a significant share. The notoriously overcrowded men’s prison housed around <a href=""https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1870266/overcrowding-in-bilibid-stands-at-358-percent-says-bucor"">30,000 by end-November 2023</a> – 10 times as many as the population in CIW.</p>



<p>If one were to assume that CIW takes 10% of the budget, that leaves just P472 million for the CIW in 2024. This already accounts for administrative and operational costs.</p>



<p>The National Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), which oversees local city and municipal jails that exclude the BuCor-supervised CIW, recorded more than 1,600 pregnant detainees and 485 births in the past two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the rare times that specialists who are part of medical missions organized by non-government organizations are able to visit, pregnant PDLs get to be examined. But more often than not, they have to make do with the little that’s available.</p>



<p>The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said that only 37 out of 84 women’s dormitories are equipped with a breastfeeding room, again indicating very limited access to maternal health services.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-dependent-on-mandaluyong-city-mc"">Dependent on Mandaluyong City MC</h5>



<p>According to Dr. Jonelle Baloloy, chief resident of the MCMC OB-GYN ward, PDLs who come to the hospital for maternal services are treated no differently from other patients, but when they need services that don’t require admission, they are prioritized in the queue since they only have limited time outside prison.</p>



<p>After securing permits to leave the facility, PDLs from CIW are accompanied by an escort and a nurse. There have been reported issues, however, according to Baloloy, of PDLs “having difficulties in securing permits to leave the facility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, for OB patients, she said, “their follow-up appointments are fixed, so those are easy. But since the hospital or local government unit pays for laboratory fees, the PDLs still have to go through the LGU for those appointments.”</p>

<p>Both CIW and MCMC assert that PDLs don’t have to shell out any money for their procedures, and if ever they do, fees are minimal, or the hospital finds a way to get the local social welfare office to pay for them. Yet women PDLs still say that what they need help the most with is still financial support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that the P15-medical budget covers the mothers only.<strong> </strong>Babies, who have their own needs like diapers, clothes, and hygiene products, are not PDLs and are excluded from the budget. While there is a separate P70-food allocation per day, or just P23.33 for a meal, pregnant PDLs and breastfeeding mothers need more because they also require <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/nutrition-during-pregnancy"">special nutrition</a>, like increased fluid intake.</p>



<p>“Most of the time, our food doesn’t have soup. We need more food, because we have increased appetites. Every time our children breastfeed, we go hungry,” said Maria.</p>



<p>The infirmary may not always be prepared to handle swift births as well.</p>



<p>“As much as possible, we really refer [births] to the nearest government hospital, MCMC. We are not equipped to deliver babies. Although there was one who went into labor quickly, and we weren’t able to bring her to the hospital on time. We were able to guide her through her labor. But we worry sometimes [about sudden births] since I’m not here 24/7, or if there’s a problem with the baby. We’re not equipped, because we are just an infirmary,” said Razon.</p>



<p>For Imelda Duras of the CHR Prevention Cluster Visitorial Division, prison medical staff should be equipped with multidisciplinary, and not just custodial, skills. Some of these skills include being able to provide psychological and social support for PDLs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So there should be health [personnel] – nurses and doctors – and we should have mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers,” said Duras.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karen Bantang from the CHR Gender Division also cited the alarming concern about postpartum depression among mother PDLs. A <a href=""https://registry.healthresearch.ph/index.php/registry?view=research&amp;layout=details&amp;cid=5177"">study</a> conducted by the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development found that 15.6% of Filipino women experience depression during pregnancy and 19.8% after childbirth. The pregnant PDLs of CIW aren’t any different.</p>



<p>With resources already at the bare minimum for women in the mothers’ ward, they also deal with the mental anguish of possibly not being able to live out the duties of motherhood. <em>(To be concluded)</em> <strong>– with reports from Angeline Braganza, Allison Co, and Iana Padilla/Rappler.com</strong></p>

Maria had to borrow money from a fellow PDL to cover her ultrasound sessions, check-ups, and laboratory fees.      The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) has a measly  P15-medicine budget per PDL , per day. According to lone resident doctor and Corrections Technical Chief Superintendent Maria Lourdes Razon, this already accounts for everything medical - from medicines to medical supplies like cotton balls and alcohol, and even period products. There's no separate budget for a PDL who is pregnant or ill.       In CIW, according to Razon, PDLs who have prescription medicines have to deposit in the pharmacy whatever money is provided by their families. The pharmacy then deducts from the fund whatever medicines PDLs avail of.       When needed, and especially for births, CIW's pregnant PDLs are referred to the Mandaluyong City Medical Center (MCMC), a stone's throw from the prison. Razon claimed that the PDLs who need procedures need not shell out any money, as it is a public hospital. But such does not seem to be the case - if Maria's experience is any indication.      Maria was lucky that her fellow PDL had an extra P3,000 she could spare from the money deposited in the pharmacy.        TOGETHER. A person deprived of liberty with her son. Photo by Michelle Abad/Rappler       Inadequate resources      A shortage of resources and medical staff compromises the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, particularly in terms of prenatal and postnatal care. This situation forces pregnant PDLs to bear the financial burden of medical expenses, as Maria herself experienced.       As of March 2024, the CIW has a population of around 3,100, but, according to Dr. Razon, the facility is meant to house only 1,000.      Besides Razon, there are only 13 nurses to tend to the over 3,000 PDLs in CIW, translating to one nurse for every 231 women, with no obstetricians, gynecologists (OB-GYN), nor midwives.      The CIW shares a line item with the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in the BuCor's budget. From the  P5.2 billion  budget the NBP and CIW shared in 2023, their budget was cut down to  P4.72 billion  in 2024. But NBP likely takes a significant share. The notoriously overcrowded men's prison housed around  30,000 by end-November 2023  - 10 times as many as the population in CIW.      If one were to assume that CIW takes 10% of the budget, that leaves just P472 million for the CIW in 2024. This already accounts for administrative and operational costs.      The National Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), which oversees local city and municipal jails that exclude the BuCor-supervised CIW, recorded more than 1,600 pregnant detainees and 485 births in the past two years.       On the rare times that specialists who are part of medical missions organized by non-government organizations are able to visit, pregnant PDLs get to be examined. But more often than not, they have to make do with the little that's available.      The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said that only 37 out of 84 women's dormitories are equipped with a breastfeeding room, again indicating very limited access to maternal health services.      Dependent on Mandaluyong City MC      According to Dr. Jonelle Baloloy, chief resident of the MCMC OB-GYN ward, PDLs who come to the hospital for maternal services are treated no differently from other patients, but when they need services that don't require admission, they are prioritized in the queue since they only have limited time outside prison.      After securing permits to leave the facility, PDLs from CIW are accompanied by an escort and a nurse. There have been reported issues, however, according to Baloloy, of PDLs ""having difficulties in securing permits to leave the facility.""       For example, for OB patients, she said, ""their follow-up appointments are fixed, so those are easy. But since the hospital or local government unit pays for laboratory fees, the PDLs still have to go through the LGU for those appointments.""        NICU. Babies pictured in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Mandaluyong City Medical Center on March 13, 2024. PDLs who give birth to babies with complications sometimes stay with their children at the hospital before being escorted back to prison. Photo by Michelle Abad/Rappler       Both CIW and MCMC assert that PDLs don't have to shell out any money for their procedures, and if ever they do, fees are minimal, or the hospital finds a way to get the local social welfare office to pay for them. Yet women PDLs still say that what they need help the most with is still financial support.       It doesn't help that the P15-medical budget covers the mothers only.   Babies, who have their own needs like diapers, clothes, and hygiene products, are not PDLs and are excluded from the budget. While there is a separate P70-food allocation per day, or just P23.33 for a meal, pregnant PDLs and breastfeeding mothers need more because they also require  special nutrition , like increased fluid intake.      ""Most of the time, our food doesn't have soup. We need more food, because we have increased appetites. Every time our children breastfeed, we go hungry,"" said Maria.      The infirmary may not always be prepared to handle swift births as well.      ""As much as possible, we really refer [births] to the nearest government hospital, MCMC. We are not equipped to deliver babies. Although there was one who went into labor quickly, and we weren't able to bring her to the hospital on time. We were able to guide her through her labor. But we worry sometimes [about sudden births] since I'm not here 24/7, or if there's a problem with the baby. We're not equipped, because we are just an infirmary,"" said Razon.      For Imelda Duras of the CHR Prevention Cluster Visitorial Division, prison medical staff should be equipped with multidisciplinary, and not just custodial, skills. Some of these skills include being able to provide psychological and social support for PDLs.       ""So there should be health [personnel] - nurses and doctors - and we should have mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers,"" said Duras.       Karen Bantang from the CHR Gender Division also cited the alarming concern about postpartum depression among mother PDLs. A  study  conducted by the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development found that 15.6% of Filipino women experience depression during pregnancy and 19.8% after childbirth. The pregnant PDLs of CIW aren't any different.      With resources already at the bare minimum for women in the mothers' ward, they also deal with the mental anguish of possibly not being able to live out the duties of motherhood.

<p>On a cold winter morning deep in the woods of Cazadero, California, Nikola Alexandre adds gasoline to a red Predator 2000 generator, flips on the engine’s switch, and pulls the recoil cord. The generator sputters briefly, then steadily starts to hum.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://humanjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Shelterwood_1400x840-jpg-1024x614.webp"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1609""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">MEMBERS of the Shelterwood Collective, an Indigenous-, Black-, and queer-led collective of land protectors and cultural strategists stewarding 900 acres of forest in Northern California.

<p>“Our connection to the outside world is satellite internet – so no power, no internet,” Alexandre says. He and others at Shelterwood Collective were left without power for two weeks in early 2023 when massive storms hit California. “We ran the generator two to three hours daily to check in with the outside world and let people know we were OK.”</p>



<p>“We joked that this was the worst-best storm of our lives. The damage is only going to get worse, but our autonomy and ability to respond to it are only going to get better,” Alexandre says. “We hope that as we build up this microgrid, we won’t be as dependent on Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E), both in the summer when they cut off power because of wildfires, and in the winter when the trees come down on the power lines. We’ll shift from a community that is vulnerable to one that is more independent and sovereign in how our energy is produced and used.”</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://humanjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EnergyAdvocates02-1024x683-1.webp"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1612""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">NIKOLA Alexandre fires up a generator at Shelterwood, a queer and trans people of color land stewardship project in Cazadero, California.

<p><a href=""https://www.shelterwoodcollective.org/"">Shelterwood Collective</a> is an Indigenous, Black, and queer-led collective of land protectors and cultural strategists stewarding 900 acres of forest in Northern California. They are among a growing number of organizations and localities trying to wrest control of their energy futures away from behemoth, dirty, and dangerous energy utilities like PG&amp;E, the largest utility in the United States. They try to put decisions about energy production, distribution, and use in the hands of the most impacted communities. For Shelterwood and others, one way to do that is to build community-governed solar microgrids.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.pge.com/"">PG&amp;E</a> is investor-owned. It serves some 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Central and Northern California. As a profit-seeking private entity whose shareholders are guaranteed a specific rate of return on investment, PG&amp;E often forgoes spending on essential measures to protect human and ecosystem health. This has resulted in catastrophic wildfires, deadly explosions, power shutoffs for millions of people, escalating rates, expansion of dirty energy projects, and vehement opposition to the increasingly popular move toward community-controlled, renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consequences have been particularly devastating for Indigenous, Black and Brown, disabled, elderly, poor, working-class, and rural communities.</p>



<p>In 2010, PG&amp;E malfeasance caused an explosion in San Bruno, California, blowing a hole in a major city and killing eight people. In 2018, PG&amp;E’s crumbling electrical grid started a fire that ravaged Paradise, also in California, killing 85 people and burning 14,000 homes. Year after year, mega fires – the Dixie, Tubbs, Zogg, and Mosquito fires, each in the top 10 fires in California history – have either been caused by PG&amp;E, or PG&amp;E has been at the center of investigations and settlements surrounding the fires. The utility <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pge-face-manslaughter-trial-deadly-california-fire-rcna68753#"">has admitted some guilt</a>, some <a href=""https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/fires/article271367012.html"">investigations</a> are ongoing, there have been <a href=""https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-approves-150-million-settlement-with-pge-for-zogg-fire-2023"">settlements</a> without <a href=""https://krcrtv.com/news/local/pge-avoids-criminal-charges-in-dixie-fire-as-part-of-settlement#"">admission of guilt</a>, and the clock is still ticking on some <a href=""https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/we-were-just-the-small-little-pawns-in-this-big-game-frustration-builds/#:~:text=Tubbs%20Fire%20victims%20are%20also,to%20a%20%2413.5%20billion%20sum"">court proceedings</a>.</p>



<p>The company has recouped its losses from these fires by hiking up costs for ratepayers, who already pay among the highest rates in the country. Additionally, instead of completing long-overdue infrastructure repair to minimize wildfires, PG&amp;E has sought to limit its liability for future fires by instituting rolling blackouts during wildfire season, leaving millions throughout the state without power, with little planning to protect communities dependent on power to live.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://humanjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EnergyAdvocates03-1024x684-1.webp"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1614""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>RECLAIM Our Power rallies outside of PG&amp;E’s San Francisco headquarters in December 2019.

<p>The ability to have uninterrupted service is particularly important for people with disabilities.</p>



<p>“This week in the Bay Area, disabled people and elders without power are having difficulty breathing, moving, eating, and staying alive,” explained the late disability justice organizer Stacey Park Milbern at a rally outside PG&amp;E’s headquarters during a power blackout in 2019. </p>



<p>“A friend is going without her nebulizer treatment. A neighbor didn’t have a way to store insulin. Another community member is homebound because she needs electricity to open the garage. People are being forced to throw out groceries without knowing where the money will come from to replace them. Blind people are crossing the street without there being traffic lights or audible signals telling them when to cross. Have you tried communicating in American Sign Language in the dark? It’s not easy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Milbern continued, “I use life-sustaining medical equipment – my ventilator – 16 hours a day. My doctor completed extensive paperwork telling PG&amp;E why I need power to live. When I called PG&amp;E, I was on hold for two hours. I hadn’t received any notice from PG&amp;E, but my house was on four different maps as losing power. To PG&amp;E, my life is not important.”</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://humanjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EnergyAdvocates04-1024x684-1.webp"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1615""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>STACEY Park Milbern, beloved disability justice activist who passed away in 2020, speaks to a crowd outside PG&amp;E headquarters in San Francisco, CA. Photo by Brooke Anderson</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite being abandoned by PG&amp;E during the wildfires and planned power outages, disabled activists <a href=""https://inthesetimes.com/article/disabled-queer-activists-isolation-mutual-aid-bay-area-covid-19"">formed mutual aid networks</a> to survive – making do-it-yourself box-fan filters, distributing KN95 masks, sourcing generators and ice, and buying hotel rooms for those in need of power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the consequences are especially stark for disabled people, who’ve long been marginalized in conversations about energy policy, communities everywhere are recognizing that if we need power to live, that power cannot be controlled by a profit-driven monopoly utility. Instead, decisions about energy production, distribution, and use must be made by people with the most at stake in those decisions.</p>



<p>Energy democracy is the fight to shift energy from a resource that has been centralized and commodified by corporations into a shared resource that is decentralized and democratized, resilient and redundant, aligned with the health of local ecosystems, and which meets the needs of workers and communities. It is a key pillar of a larger <a href=""https://movementgeneration.org/justtransition/"">Just Transition platform</a>.</p>



<p>“Everyone waits in fear of a Wall Street corporation pressing a red button to turn their power on or off,” says Pete Woiwode, co-director of the <a href=""https://reclaimourpowerca.org/"">Reclaim Our Power: Utility Justice Campaign</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if we flipped that and the folks who make the decisions about whose needs to prioritize – who has access to life-giving energy – are the folks most vulnerable in these scenarios? Energy can be a process by which we upend generations of horrific injustice and put our lives, livelihoods, and ecosystems at the center.”</p>



<p>Increasingly exasperated with powerful, polluting utility companies, fire survivors, environmental justice communities, and people with disabilities formed Reclaim Our Power to organize for renewable energy, public ownership, and community control. They have repeatedly called on California Governor Gavin Newsom to deny PG&amp;E’s safety certificate, or what advocates have dubbed PG&amp;E’s “license to burn.” Reclaim Our Power’s sister organization, <a href=""https://www.localcleanenergy.org/"">Local Clean Energy Alliance</a>, was essential in creating <a href=""http://yesmagazine.org/issue/just-transition/2017/09/28/how-california-could-get-to-100-percent-renewable-energy"">community choice energy agencies</a> throughout the state, which put the decision about where to procure energy in the hands of local communities.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://humanjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EnergyAdvocates05-1024x684-1.webp"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1616""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>PETE Woiwode, Reclaim Our Power co-director, leads chants at an action outside of a PG&amp;E facility in 2023.

<p>While Reclaim Our Power tries to pry loose PG&amp;E’s stranglehold on California’s energy, the coalition is planting the seeds of an energy future beyond PG&amp;E by supporting a cohort of local communities in designing and constructing their own solar microgrids. The idea is simple: To effectively control the energy system, people need to practice.</p>



<p>That cohort includes fire-affected migrants in Sonoma County, Black high school students in East Oakland, immigrant elders in Oakland Chinatown, and queer and trans people of color acting as land stewards at Shelterwood. Through the cohort, 10 organizations thus far have learned about the energy system, their own consumption needs, and emerging technology.</p>



<p>For some in the cohort – like Shelterwood – controlling their own energy is critical.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://humanjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EnergyAdvocates06-1024x684-1.webp"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1617""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>JOAN Lora inspects a propane tank damaged by a fallen tree during the winter 2023 storms in Northern California. The tree that fell has been tagged for removal by PG&amp;E but never taken down by the agency. Photo by Brooke Anderson</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Shelterwood centers queer and trans folks in ecology. It means a lot, especially in a community in which we’re ostracized into the margins or forced into the cities for protection,” says Layel Camargo, co-founder and co-executive director of Shelterwood, and an Indigenous (Yaqui and Mayo of the Sonoran Desert) trans organizer and cultural worker. “We’re returning our people back to the land.”</p>



<p>But Shelterwood is in the heart of Northern California’s wildfire country, Camargo explains. When it’s hot and windy, PG&amp;E turns off the power without warning. This is a problem for Shelterwood, which sits outside of cellular service and relies on electricity to power satellite phones. Shelterwood also depends on power for its housing, kitchen, retreat center, phones, lights, internet, electric vehicles, and electric tools.</p>



<p>“Rural communities are really at the hands of these monopolized energy companies. In an emergency, without power, we couldn’t call 911. There’d be no way to get information about an evacuation,” Camargo says. “The best way for us to survive out here, and to stay ecologically aligned, is to have as much control of our utilities as we can.”</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://humanjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EnergyAdvocates07-1024x684-1.webp"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1618""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>LAYEL Camargo (left) and Nikola Alexandre (right) stand amidst the burn piles at Shelterwood in May 2023. The land stewards did controlled burns (to prevent wildfire spread) on their land. Photo by Brooke Anderson</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For Shelterwood, building out its own microgrid isn’t just practical, it’s also political.</p>



<p>“When I heard about the counts of manslaughter against PG&amp;E after fires, I felt like it was my responsibility that if I was going to be in charge of electrical infrastructure for a 900-acre forest I would want to be less dependent on a company where our values are not aligned,” Camargo says.</p>



<p>In addition to solar, Shelterwood is also installing a hydro microgrid. This will be used in winter when the sun is less plentiful but the water is flowing through the creeks, streams, and gullies on their land, sometimes up to 25 gallons per minute.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-energy-insurrection"">Energy insurrection</h5>



<p>California isn’t the only place building out microgrids as part of new energy futures. Puerto Rico has traditionally imported most of its energy, which means that it is both more fossil-fuel intensive and expensive. Importing energy also leaves the archipelago more vulnerable to energy shortages and outages in times of disaster.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://humanjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EnergyAdvocates08-1024x684-1.webp"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1620""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>ARTURO Massol Deyá of Casa Pueblo in Adjuntas talks about their work to build an “energy insurrection” in Puerto Rico.

<p>When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, it knocked out power to most of the island. The small town of Adjuntas was one of the last regions reached by FEMA, a full month after the hurricane hit. Before the storm, the 45 solar panels on <a href=""https://casapueblo.org/"">Casa Pueblo</a>, a community center in Adjuntas, had been something of an oddity. But suddenly without electricity on the island, Casa Pueblo became an instant “energy oasis.” People came from all over the island to store refrigerated medicine, plug in their respiratory equipment, and charge their cell phones.</p>



<p>In the immediate aftermath of the storm, Casa Pueblo distributed 14,000 solar lanterns to residents, reducing the risk of fire by candlelight and the vulnerability of elders. It equipped 10 homes with extra energy for dialysis and small refrigerators for insulin and antibiotics to meet critical health needs. With their solar power, they set up a public satellite phone, which people lined up to use to contact their families. They also recorded one-minute messages for residents to play on-air from their solar-powered radio station.</p>



<p>Post-hurricane, Casa Pueblo built out the island’s first community-controlled microgrid. It outfitted an additional 150 homes with solar energy, installed 50 full-sized refrigerators in solar-powered homes, and powered a barbershop, two hardware stores, an agricultural center, two elder homes, the fire station, a restaurant, a pizzeria, five mini markets, a solar cinema, the transmission tower of the radio station, the elementary school, and a pharmacy, among others.</p>



<p>“Everyone has a right to energy, not just those who can pay for or finance solar power,” says Arturo Massol Deyá, executive director of Casa Pueblo.</p>



<p>For these homes and businesses, solar used to be the backup source of energy. Now, Puerto Rico’s main private utility company, PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority), is the backup. Energy bills for solar users in Adjuntas have gone down from $85 per month on PREPA (fossil fuels) to $5 per month on solar. Casa Pueblo is now working to bring ‘second life’ used-car batteries to Adjuntas to serve as solar storage.</p>



<p>“Energy is the capacity to do work. We don’t enjoy the wealth made from our work. One way to decolonize Puerto Rico is in practical terms: To create energy independence. We can be producers, not consumers. We don’t need coal and gas. We have sun and wind,” Massol Deyá says. “We’re calling for an energy insurrection. We’re not going to wait for the government. We’re going to unplug ourselves.”</p>

<p>The &#8220;energy insurrection&#8221; in Puerto Rico is an inspiration for many US energy-democracy activists, but especially for Selena Feliciano, national campaign coordinator of the <a href=""https://energydemocracy.us/"">Energy Democracy Project</a> and herself Puerto Rican.</p>



<p>“I have Taíno [the Indigenous peoples of Puerto Rico] roots in my family. Indigeneity understands that energy is not wires, not technology. It’s the sun. It’s what connects us, and keeps us going. It’s only in the last 150 years that we’ve equated energy with infrastructure,” says Feliciano. “The people of Puerto Rico have held steadfast to honoring the tradition of energy beyond technology, and as a basis of resistance.”</p>

<p>The Energy Democracy Project is a collaboration of 40 frontline organizations in the US to advance energy democracy. Their members hail from Alaska to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and from Jackson, Mississippi, to the Gulf South.</p>



<p>It will take statewide policy change to dismantle private utilities like PG&amp;E and to truly move an energy transition at scale. To get there, microgrids – like at Shelterwood and Casa Pueblo – make concrete improvements in people’s lives, foster familiarity with the technology, bring the conversation into people’s homes, allow to practice self-governance in place, and ignite political imaginations about an energy future beyond private utility companies.</p>



<p>“Energy Democracy rests on community decision-making, but if the community doesn’t know about the available technology or doesn’t know that an alternative is possible, it’s hard to organize around it,” adds Feliciano. “That’s why these first steps are so important—for people to experience these possible configurations and solutions for themselves.”</p>



<p>“The microgrids point to how else we can do it. It creates a real choice between PG&amp;E and this other thing we’ve built. It’s a world that people can fight for, and it is within reach,” Woiwode says. “However, no one technology, microgrids included, is the answer to true energy democracy. If a Google campus, Chevron refinery, and a prison used microgrid technology, but did so in a way that didn’t actively disrupt the racist, extractive, anti-democratic structure of our current system, we would not be any closer to the energy future we all need.”</p>



<p>A just transition in the energy sector isn’t merely a question of technology—replacing coal, “natural” gas, or nuclear power with solar, wind, or hydropower—but rather a political struggle over who governs decisions about the resources it takes to power our lives. Like the double meaning in Reclaim Our Power’s name, it’s not just electric power, but political power.</p>



<p>“It’s not just about the poles, wires, and technology. It’s about the decision points in people’s lives,” Woiwode says.</p>



<p>It is the collective contending with those decision points, say energy democracy activists, that define energy democracy. Unplugging ourselves, as Massol Deyá calls for, doesn’t mean we all act as individuals. Rather, it is the relationships between microgrids that make the system resilient and redundant. Decentralization without democratization would only exacerbate existing inequities.</p>



<p>“Our vision is not that everyone takes their ball and goes home to self-contained units of energy distribution. Energy sovereignty does not mean getting out, vanishing, with wealthy white people disappearing from the system. There needs to be connective tissue,” Woiwode says. “What we want is a mosaic of interconnected community—like the forest.”</p>



<p>The energy justice movement doesn’t seek merely to reform the existing shareholder-owned governance structure of our energy system. It is not a call for a kinder, gentler, slightly less deadly PG&amp;E or PREPA. Rather, it is a reckoning with how the privatization and enclosure of energy has estranged us from earth’s regenerative cycles. It is an invitation to restore our relationship to energy and each other. It is a reminder that there is enough energy for all when we can have a reflexive, responsive relationship to place and earth’s living systems. It is a course correction that devolves governance down to the level of greatest impact so that decisions aren’t made by a few men with MBAs, tucked safely away in corporate offices, but by people in across communities whose lives are most impacted by the tough choices in precarious times. It is an opportunity to practice people-to-people, radical self-governance.</p>



<p>As <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/15/maui-fires-power-line-cause/"">residents of Lahaina, Maui, tragically learned the past August</a>, when climate disasters like wildfires and superstorms intensify it only further reveals the failures and fractures of our existing energy system that burns fossil fuels in one place and transmits that energy over large swaths of land, according to the whims of a profit-maximizing corporation. But grassroots activists on the ground are building models of the kind of renewable, affordable, interconnected, community-governed energy systems needed for energy democracy. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong> </p>

","<p>Communities in California and Puerto Rico are disputing governance by rejecting the current structure of their electricity system – and taking it back to the people</p>

Photo by Brooke Anderson       ""Our connection to the outside world is satellite internet - so no power, no internet,"" Alexandre says. He and others at Shelterwood Collective were left without power for two weeks in early 2023 when massive storms hit California. ""We ran the generator two to three hours daily to check in with the outside world and let people know we were OK.""      ""We joked that this was the worst-best storm of our lives. The damage is only going to get worse, but our autonomy and ability to respond to it are only going to get better,"" Alexandre says. ""We hope that as we build up this microgrid, we won't be as dependent on Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), both in the summer when they cut off power because of wildfires, and in the winter when the trees come down on the power lines. We'll shift from a community that is vulnerable to one that is more independent and sovereign in how our energy is produced and used.""        NIKOLA Alexandre fires up a generator at Shelterwood, a queer and trans people of color land stewardship project in Cazadero, California. Photo by Brooke Anderson        Shelterwood Collective  is an Indigenous, Black, and queer-led collective of land protectors and cultural strategists stewarding 900 acres of forest in Northern California. They are among a growing number of organizations and localities trying to wrest control of their energy futures away from behemoth, dirty, and dangerous energy utilities like PG&E, the largest utility in the United States. They try to put decisions about energy production, distribution, and use in the hands of the most impacted communities. For Shelterwood and others, one way to do that is to build community-governed solar microgrids.        PG&E  is investor-owned. It serves some 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Central and Northern California. As a profit-seeking private entity whose shareholders are guaranteed a specific rate of return on investment, PG&E often forgoes spending on essential measures to protect human and ecosystem health. This has resulted in catastrophic wildfires, deadly explosions, power shutoffs for millions of people, escalating rates, expansion of dirty energy projects, and vehement opposition to the increasingly popular move toward community-controlled, renewable energy.       The consequences have been particularly devastating for Indigenous, Black and Brown, disabled, elderly, poor, working-class, and rural communities.      In 2010, PG&E malfeasance caused an explosion in San Bruno, California, blowing a hole in a major city and killing eight people. In 2018, PG&E's crumbling electrical grid started a fire that ravaged Paradise, also in California, killing 85 people and burning 14,000 homes. Year after year, mega fires - the Dixie, Tubbs, Zogg, and Mosquito fires, each in the top 10 fires in California history - have either been caused by PG&E, or PG&E has been at the center of investigations and settlements surrounding the fires. The utility  has admitted some guilt , some  investigations  are ongoing, there have been  settlements  without  admission of guilt , and the clock is still ticking on some  court proceedings .      The company has recouped its losses from these fires by hiking up costs for ratepayers, who already pay among the highest rates in the country. Additionally, instead of completing long-overdue infrastructure repair to minimize wildfires, PG&E has sought to limit its liability for future fires by instituting rolling blackouts during wildfire season, leaving millions throughout the state without power, with little planning to protect communities dependent on power to live.         RECLAIM Our Power rallies outside of PG&E's San Francisco headquarters in December 2019. Photo by Brooke Anderson        The ability to have uninterrupted service is particularly important for people with disabilities.      ""This week in the Bay Area, disabled people and elders without power are having difficulty breathing, moving, eating, and staying alive,"" explained the late disability justice organizer Stacey Park Milbern at a rally outside PG&E's headquarters during a power blackout in 2019.       ""A friend is going without her nebulizer treatment. A neighbor didn't have a way to store insulin. Another community member is homebound because she needs electricity to open the garage. People are being forced to throw out groceries without knowing where the money will come from to replace them. Blind people are crossing the street without there being traffic lights or audible signals telling them when to cross. Have you tried communicating in American Sign Language in the dark? It's not easy.""       Milbern continued, ""I use life-sustaining medical equipment - my ventilator - 16 hours a day. My doctor completed extensive paperwork telling PG&E why I need power to live. When I called PG&E, I was on hold for two hours. I hadn't received any notice from PG&E, but my house was on four different maps as losing power. To PG&E, my life is not important.""         STACEY Park Milbern, beloved disability justice activist who passed away in 2020, speaks to a crowd outside PG&E headquarters in San Francisco, CA. Photo by Brooke Anderson        Despite being abandoned by PG&E during the wildfires and planned power outages, disabled activists  formed mutual aid networks  to survive - making do-it-yourself box-fan filters, distributing KN95 masks, sourcing generators and ice, and buying hotel rooms for those in need of power.       While the consequences are especially stark for disabled people, who've long been marginalized in conversations about energy policy, communities everywhere are recognizing that if we need power to live, that power cannot be controlled by a profit-driven monopoly utility. Instead, decisions about energy production, distribution, and use must be made by people with the most at stake in those decisions.      Energy democracy is the fight to shift energy from a resource that has been centralized and commodified by corporations into a shared resource that is decentralized and democratized, resilient and redundant, aligned with the health of local ecosystems, and which meets the needs of workers and communities. It is a key pillar of a larger  Just Transition platform .      ""Everyone waits in fear of a Wall Street corporation pressing a red button to turn their power on or off,"" says Pete Woiwode, co-director of the  Reclaim Our Power: Utility Justice Campaign .       ""What if we flipped that and the folks who make the decisions about whose needs to prioritize - who has access to life-giving energy - are the folks most vulnerable in these scenarios? Energy can be a process by which we upend generations of horrific injustice and put our lives, livelihoods, and ecosystems at the center.""      Increasingly exasperated with powerful, polluting utility companies, fire survivors, environmental justice communities, and people with disabilities formed Reclaim Our Power to organize for renewable energy, public ownership, and community control. They have repeatedly called on California Governor Gavin Newsom to deny PG&E's safety certificate, or what advocates have dubbed PG&E's ""license to burn."" Reclaim Our Power's sister organization,  Local Clean Energy Alliance , was essential in creating  community choice energy agencies  throughout the state, which put the decision about where to procure energy in the hands of local communities.         PETE Woiwode, Reclaim Our Power co-director, leads chants at an action outside of a PG&E facility in 2023. Photo by Brooke Anderson        While Reclaim Our Power tries to pry loose PG&E's stranglehold on California's energy, the coalition is planting the seeds of an energy future beyond PG&E by supporting a cohort of local communities in designing and constructing their own solar microgrids. The idea is simple: To effectively control the energy system, people need to practice.      That cohort includes fire-affected migrants in Sonoma County, Black high school students in East Oakland, immigrant elders in Oakland Chinatown, and queer and trans people of color acting as land stewards at Shelterwood. Through the cohort, 10 organizations thus far have learned about the energy system, their own consumption needs, and emerging technology.      For some in the cohort - like Shelterwood - controlling their own energy is critical.         JOAN Lora inspects a propane tank damaged by a fallen tree during the winter 2023 storms in Northern California. The tree that fell has been tagged for removal by PG&E but never taken down by the agency. Photo by Brooke Anderson        ""Shelterwood centers queer and trans folks in ecology. It means a lot, especially in a community in which we're ostracized into the margins or forced into the cities for protection,"" says Layel Camargo, co-founder and co-executive director of Shelterwood, and an Indigenous (Yaqui and Mayo of the Sonoran Desert) trans organizer and cultural worker. ""We're returning our people back to the land.""      But Shelterwood is in the heart of Northern California's wildfire country, Camargo explains. When it's hot and windy, PG&E turns off the power without warning. This is a problem for Shelterwood, which sits outside of cellular service and relies on electricity to power satellite phones. Shelterwood also depends on power for its housing, kitchen, retreat center, phones, lights, internet, electric vehicles, and electric tools.      ""Rural communities are really at the hands of these monopolized energy companies. In an emergency, without power, we couldn't call 911. There'd be no way to get information about an evacuation,"" Camargo says. ""The best way for us to survive out here, and to stay ecologically aligned, is to have as much control of our utilities as we can.""         LAYEL Camargo (left) and Nikola Alexandre (right) stand amidst the burn piles at Shelterwood in May 2023. The land stewards did controlled burns (to prevent wildfire spread) on their land. Photo by Brooke Anderson        For Shelterwood, building out its own microgrid isn't just practical, it's also political.      ""When I heard about the counts of manslaughter against PG&E after fires, I felt like it was my responsibility that if I was going to be in charge of electrical infrastructure for a 900-acre forest I would want to be less dependent on a company where our values are not aligned,"" Camargo says.      In addition to solar, Shelterwood is also installing a hydro microgrid. This will be used in winter when the sun is less plentiful but the water is flowing through the creeks, streams, and gullies on their land, sometimes up to 25 gallons per minute.      Energy insurrection      California isn't the only place building out microgrids as part of new energy futures. Puerto Rico has traditionally imported most of its energy, which means that it is both more fossil-fuel intensive and expensive. Importing energy also leaves the archipelago more vulnerable to energy shortages and outages in times of disaster.         ARTURO Massol Deya of Casa Pueblo in Adjuntas talks about their work to build an ""energy insurrection"" in Puerto Rico. Photo by Brooke Anderson        When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, it knocked out power to most of the island. The small town of Adjuntas was one of the last regions reached by FEMA, a full month after the hurricane hit. Before the storm, the 45 solar panels on  Casa Pueblo , a community center in Adjuntas, had been something of an oddity. But suddenly without electricity on the island, Casa Pueblo became an instant ""energy oasis."" People came from all over the island to store refrigerated medicine, plug in their respiratory equipment, and charge their cell phones.      In the immediate aftermath of the storm, Casa Pueblo distributed 14,000 solar lanterns to residents, reducing the risk of fire by candlelight and the vulnerability of elders. It equipped 10 homes with extra energy for dialysis and small refrigerators for insulin and antibiotics to meet critical health needs. With their solar power, they set up a public satellite phone, which people lined up to use to contact their families. They also recorded one-minute messages for residents to play on-air from their solar-powered radio station.      Post-hurricane, Casa Pueblo built out the island's first community-controlled microgrid. It outfitted an additional 150 homes with solar energy, installed 50 full-sized refrigerators in solar-powered homes, and powered a barbershop, two hardware stores, an agricultural center, two elder homes, the fire station, a restaurant, a pizzeria, five mini markets, a solar cinema, the transmission tower of the radio station, the elementary school, and a pharmacy, among others.      ""Everyone has a right to energy, not just those who can pay for or finance solar power,"" says Arturo Massol Deya, executive director of Casa Pueblo.

2630788,buhing-kalbaryo-play-devotion-cebu,&#8216;Buhing Kalbaryo&#8217;: A Cebuano play of devotion,"
<p>CEBU, Philippines – “<em>Mura ra’g nangumpisal</em> (It’s just like a confession),” 34-year-old Raffy Anor told Rappler on Holy Thursday, March 28.</p>



<p>For the 27th run of the <em>Buhing Kalbaryo</em> (Living Calvary), a Cebuano biblical play organized by the Cebu City government, Anor played the role of Jesus Christ – a person who Anor considers his personal friend and savior.</p>



<p>Anor has been playing this role since 2012. He knows how it feels to carry the cross and he understands the responsibility of doing so.</p>



<p>Every year, <em>Buhing Kalbaryo</em> retells the biblical narratives about Christ’s suffering and mission to save humanity. The event features theatrical performances and a reenactment of Christ’s final moments before the crucifixion.</p>



<p>Describing the feeling of portraying Christ, Anor told Rappler that it’s like being relieved of one’s sins.</p>



<p>“<em>Murag mugaan imung lawas. Murag mawala imuhang mga sala </em>(It’s like your body feels lighter. It’s like all of your sins just go away),” the actor said.</p>

<p>The first<em> Buhing Kalbaryo</em> was conceptualized in 1997, through the coordination of then-city councilor Mike Rama and members of the Catholic Church in Cebu. It became an annual tradition during the commemoration of the Holy Week.</p>



<p>“The late Cardinal Julio Rosales, the former archbishop, really liked these theater presentations of the reenactments because he said it’s a very good tool for evangelization and just like the conviction of the mayor, it’s become a ‘refueling’ during the season of Lent,” overall director Elmer Labella told Rappler on Thursday evening.</p>



<p>On Good Friday, March 29, the event started with the baptism of Christ, followed by brief musical presentations that were newly added to this year’s <em>Buhing Kalbaryo</em> and a <em>Via Crucis</em> (Way of the Cross) from Barangay San Nicolas Proper to Barangay Guadalupe.</p>

For the 27th run of the  Buhing Kalbaryo  (Living Calvary), a Cebuano biblical play organized by the Cebu City government, Anor played the role of Jesus Christ - a person who Anor considers his personal friend and savior.      Anor has been playing this role since 2012. He knows how it feels to carry the cross and he understands the responsibility of doing so.      Every year,  Buhing Kalbaryo  retells the biblical narratives about Christ's suffering and mission to save humanity. The event features theatrical performances and a reenactment of Christ's final moments before the crucifixion.      Describing the feeling of portraying Christ, Anor told Rappler that it's like being relieved of one's sins.      "" Murag mugaan imung lawas. Murag mawala imuhang mga sala  (It's like your body feels lighter. It's like all of your sins just go away),"" the actor said.

It became an annual tradition during the commemoration of the Holy Week.      ""The late Cardinal Julio Rosales, the former archbishop, really liked these theater presentations of the reenactments because he said it's a very good tool for evangelization and just like the conviction of the mayor, it's become a 'refueling' during the season of Lent,"" overall director Elmer Labella told Rappler on Thursday evening.      On Good Friday, March 29, the event started with the baptism of Christ, followed by brief musical presentations that were newly added to this year's  Buhing Kalbaryo  and a  Via Crucis  (Way of the Cross) from Barangay San Nicolas Proper to Barangay Guadalupe.

<p>NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – Residents called on the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to look into the water quality of a river in Binalbagan town, Negros Occidental, because the stench emanating from it has been affecting at least four villages.</p>



<p>Fisherman Salvador Bayona, speaking on behalf of the residents of Barangay Canmuros, told Rappler on Wednesday, March 27, that they have been enduring the foul odor and murky water of the Binalbagan River since late 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bayona also appealed for the intervention of Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga, saying he and other residents were worried about the river&#8217;s biodiversity.</p>



<p>He said the river stench has affected the villages of Marina, San Juan, Progreso, and Canmuros. Binalbagan town is approximately 62 kilometers south of Bacolod City.</p>



<p>One of the villages, Canmuros, is home to the Mangrove Eco Park and Wild Life Sanctuary, which is a protected area dedicated to the conservation and protection of the town’s flora and fauna.</p>



<p>Bayona said the pollution has been posing health risks and aggravated the conditions of residents with underlying respiratory conditions.</p>



<p>Even before the situation worsened in late 2023, however, residents had been raising concerns about the river pollution for at least a decade, but the villagers’ pleas fell on deaf ears, he said.</p>

2630725,defense-department-statement-china-sea-dispute-march-29-2024,Philippines reminds China: We’re not aggressors in West Philippine Sea ,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ defense department reminded its Chinese counterpart on Friday, March 29, that Filipinos are not the “aggressors” in the South China Sea. </p>



<p>“The world has seen and knows that the Filipino people are not aggressors. We will never seek a fight or trouble. Neither will we be cowed into silence, submission, or subservience,” the Department of National Defense (DND) said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DND was reacting to China&#8217;s defense ministry, who said in a statement on Thursday, March 28, that Manila’s “harassment and provocations [were] the immediate cause of the recent escalation of the South China Sea issue.” </p>



<p>“China’s defense ministry statement clearly reflects their isolation from the rest of the world on their illegal and uncivilized activities in the West Philippine Sea. It also shows the inability of the Chinese government to conduct open, transparent, and legal negotiations. Their repertoire consists only of patronizing and, failing that, intimidating smaller countries,” said the Philippines’ defense department.</p>



<p>The Chinese defense ministry’s statement was released to media in Manila shortly after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced a “<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/marcos-vows-countermeasures-against-china-attacks-march-28-2024"">countermeasure package</a>” in the face of China’s “open, unabating, and illegal, coercive, aggressive, and dangerous attacks.” </p>



<p>Marcos, in a post on his social media accounts, said the plan was a result of meetings with Philippine defense officials, as well as communication with allies in the international community. </p>



<p>The Philippine President, in his statement, added: “We seek no conflict with any nation, more so nations that purport and claim to be our friends, but we will not be cowed into silence, submission, or subservience. Filipinos do not yield.”</p>



<p>The latest exchange between the two Asian countries are indicative of rising tensions between Manila and Beijing over activities in the West Philippine Sea, which includes the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China insists practically the entire South China Sea is theirs, ignoring a 2016 arbitral award that deemed this claim illegal.</p>



<p>Under Marcos – in direct contrast to his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte – the Philippines has been more assertive in protecting its sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea, as well as exposing China’s harassment whenever Filipinos conduct missions in those waters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last Saturday, March 23, three soldiers were hurt and a civilian supply ship was <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/china-water-cannon-ayungin-shoal-march-23-2024/"">badly damaged</a> after the China Coast Guard used water cannons against the smaller Unaizah May 4. Just weeks before, the same wooden supply ship was damaged for the same reason. </p>



<p>But the March 2024 incidents in the West Philippine Sea are only the latest in a long list of maritime confrontations between the two countries. The Philippines has reported collisions, dangerous maneuvers, and blocking attempts, particularly during missions to bring supplies to a military outpost in Ayungin Shoal, as well as attempts to bring supplies to fisherfolk in Scarborough Shoal.</p>



<p>Both features are just a little over 100 nautical miles from Philippine shores.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Marcos, too, the Philippines has upped defense ties with its allies and partners – most notably the United States, which China accuses of “interference” in the South China Sea. Marcos has repeatedly said issues in the South China Sea must be viewed beyond the lens of the US-China competition, and as the Philippines’ assertion of its own interests. </p>



<p>China has also lashed out at journalists who join Philippine missions to Ayungin Shoal, claiming &#8220;manipulation&#8221; of video and reports. <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/journalists-statements-reactions-slam-china-manipulation-claims/"">Journalists in the Philippines have hit back</a>, calling Beijing&#8217;s allegations a &#8220;barefaced lie.&#8221; <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE, Philippines – A veteran Moro fighter, 63-year-old Abubakar Usop, continues to report for guard duty to help secure the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) Camp Darapanan in Sultan Kudarat town and the communities around it.</p>



<p>Darapanan is where MILF leaders, who are now government officials and lawmakers, chose to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/53993-infographic-bangsamoro-peace-deal/"">Comprehensive Agreement of the Bangsamoro</a> (CAB), a <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/54041-murad-milf-crowning-glory-peace-agreement/"">peace accord on March 27, 2014</a>, that led to the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).</p>



<p>Usop, like many of his colleagues in the Darapanan security detail, is not from Darapanan but has come to render guard duty for 15 days and wait to be replaced with another group.</p>



<p>“We have to make sure that all is safe here,” he said on Wednesday, March 27, pointing out the big difference in what they do now compared to recent years.</p>



<p>“There is now peace, and people here can sleep undisturbed,” said the survivor of the government&#8217;s all-out offensives against the MILF more than a decade ago.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-declining-poverty-rate"">Declining poverty rate</h5>



<p>During the commemoration rites on Wednesday, March 27, BARMM Chief Minister Ahod Balawag “Al Haj Murad” Ebrahim, who is also the MILF chairman, said the CAB signing during the presidency of the late Benigno Aquino III in 2014 <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/48841-timeline-bangsamoro/"">opened the doors</a> to “correcting historical injustices and dismantling oppressive systems,” which hindered the development of the region and its people.</p>



<p>Expressing gratitude to past and present leaders of the country for their support in implementing the CAB, Ebrahim said the new Bangsamoro government was able to “reduce the region’s poverty rates, increase investments, make available employment opportunities, and work for the opening of economic activities.”</p>



<p>Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) show a significant decline in BARMM&#8217;s poverty incidence by 29.8% in 2021 from 54.20% in 2018. This was accompanied by a 56% increase in investments.</p>



<p>Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr. said the CAB symbolizes the government’s desire to uplift the lives of the Bangsamoro people and transform their areas into peaceful, progressive, and resilient communities.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Survivor&#8217;s story</h5>



<p>A few meters from the gates of the camp where the commemoration rites were being held, 32-year-old college student Zoraini Rashid tended to her uncle’s small <em>sari-sari</em> (variety) store.</p>



<p>Rashid told Rappler that in her desire to help her family, she decided to remain single, “so I can freely work with the intention to lift my siblings and parents out of poverty.”</p>



<p>Left with no other option, her parents had to agree with her decision to work as a domestic in the Middle East to be safe from the frequent armed clashes in their town in Talayan, Rashid said as she narrated her story of dodging bullets as a young girl.</p>

Zoraini Rashid tends to her uncle&#8217;s small store with an MILF flag conspicuously displayed in Darapanan, Sultan Kudarat. Rommel Rebollido/Rappler</figcaption></figure>



<p>On her return from abroad in 2018, Rashid opted to stay with her relatives in Darapanan for security reasons even as she observed that <em>“malaki ang pinagbago, wala nang giyera, nakakapagaral na ako </em>(there is a big difference now, no more war, I can go to school).”</p>



<p>She is about to complete a course in Islamic Studies at the Cotabato State University, made possible by the free education program of the Bangsamoro government. Free education means free tuition only, no allowance or stipend.</p>



<p>Rashid wanted to be a physician, a childhood dream, but she said, <em>“Hindi na kakayanin, tumatanda na ako at wala nang pera </em>(I can’t afford it anymore. I’m getting old, and I don&#8217;t have the money for it).”</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Can gains be sustained?</h5>



<p>Abet Soledo, 53, a resident of Barangay Simuay, Sultan Kudarat, also fled the fighting during the government’s all-out war launched by the administration of then-president Joseph Estrada.</p>



<p>He went to work abroad as a utility worker for a carpet dealer in Saudi Arabia and returned home when he learned that the MILF and the Philippine government came to a truce in 2014.</p>



<p><em>“Nakabalik ako tapos na ang giyera, hindi talaga maganda ang giyera</em> (I was able to return when the war was over; war is really no good),” Soledo said, recalling the days when his family would evacuate to avoid hostilities.</p>



<p>Soledo said it was good that the Bangsamoro stood their ground and fought.</p>



<p>Asked about the ongoing celebration, he said, <em>“Wala nang giyera, tahimik na.</em> (No more war, it is already peaceful).”</p>



<p>He, however, had no answer when asked if he thought the present gains can be sustained.</p>



<p>In nearby Datu Odin Sinsuat town, also in Maguindanao del Norte, residents fled their homes on Monday, March 25, to avoid fighting between a group of the MILF and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). </p>



<p>The Muslim-majority region will hold its first parliamentary elections since its creation, simultaneously with the mid-term national and local elections, next year.

Darapanan is where MILF leaders, who are now government officials and lawmakers, chose to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the  Comprehensive Agreement of the Bangsamoro  (CAB), a  peace accord on March 27, 2014 , that led to the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).      Usop, like many of his colleagues in the Darapanan security detail, is not from Darapanan but has come to render guard duty for 15 days and wait to be replaced with another group.      ""We have to make sure that all is safe here,"" he said on Wednesday, March 27, pointing out the big difference in what they do now compared to recent years.      ""There is now peace, and people here can sleep undisturbed,"" said the survivor of the government's all-out offensives against the MILF more than a decade ago.      Declining poverty rate      During the commemoration rites on Wednesday, March 27, BARMM Chief Minister Ahod Balawag ""Al Haj Murad"" Ebrahim, who is also the MILF chairman, said the CAB signing during the presidency of the late Benigno Aquino III in 2014  opened the doors  to ""correcting historical injustices and dismantling oppressive systems,"" which hindered the development of the region and its people.      Expressing gratitude to past and present leaders of the country for their support in implementing the CAB, Ebrahim said the new Bangsamoro government was able to ""reduce the region's poverty rates, increase investments, make available employment opportunities, and work for the opening of economic activities.""      Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) show a significant decline in BARMM's poverty incidence by 29.8% in 2021 from 54.20% in 2018. This was accompanied by a 56% increase in investments.      Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr. said the CAB symbolizes the government's desire to uplift the lives of the Bangsamoro people and transform their areas into peaceful, progressive, and resilient communities.      Survivor's story      A few meters from the gates of the camp where the commemoration rites were being held, 32-year-old college student Zoraini Rashid tended to her uncle's small  sari-sari  (variety) store.      Rashid told Rappler that in her desire to help her family, she decided to remain single, ""so I can freely work with the intention to lift my siblings and parents out of poverty.""      Left with no other option, her parents had to agree with her decision to work as a domestic in the Middle East to be safe from the frequent armed clashes in their town in Talayan, Rashid said as she narrated her story of dodging bullets as a young girl.        DISPLAY. Zoraini Rashid tends to her uncle's small store with an MILF flag conspicuously displayed in Darapanan, Sultan Kudarat. Rommel Rebollido/Rappler       On her return from abroad in 2018, Rashid opted to stay with her relatives in Darapanan for security reasons even as she observed that  ""malaki ang pinagbago, wala nang giyera, nakakapagaral na ako  (there is a big difference now, no more war, I can go to school).""      She is about to complete a course in Islamic Studies at the Cotabato State University, made possible by the free education program of the Bangsamoro government. Free education means free tuition only, no allowance or stipend.      Rashid wanted to be a physician, a childhood dream, but she said,  ""Hindi na kakayanin, tumatanda na ako at wala nang pera  (I can't afford it anymore. I'm getting old, and I don't have the money for it).""      Can gains be sustained?      Abet Soledo, 53, a resident of Barangay Simuay, Sultan Kudarat, also fled the fighting during the government's all-out war launched by the administration of then-president Joseph Estrada.      He went to work abroad as a utility worker for a carpet dealer in Saudi Arabia and returned home when he learned that the MILF and the Philippine government came to a truce in 2014.       ""Nakabalik ako tapos na ang giyera, hindi talaga maganda ang giyera  (I was able to return when the war was over; war is really no good),"" Soledo said, recalling the days when his family would evacuate to avoid hostilities.      Soledo said it was good that the Bangsamoro stood their ground and fought.      Asked about the ongoing celebration, he said,  ""Wala nang giyera, tahimik na.  (No more war, it is already peaceful).""      He, however, had no answer when asked if he thought the present gains can be sustained.      In nearby Datu Odin Sinsuat town, also in Maguindanao del Norte, residents fled their homes on Monday, March 25, to avoid fighting between a group of the MILF and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).       The Muslim-majority region will hold its first parliamentary elections since its creation, simultaneously with the mid-term national and local elections, next year. The International Crisis Group, based in Brussels, earlier cautioned that armed groups and political disputes ahead of the 2025 elections pose potential threats to BARMM's stability.-  Rappler.com   ",Positive

<p>Taiwan&#8217;s navy chief, Tang Hua, will visit the United States from next week to attend a military ceremony and discuss how to boost bilateral naval cooperation as China raises threats toward the island, six people briefed on the trip said.</p>



<p>While Taiwan and the United States have a close relationship, it is unofficial, as Washington formally recognizes China, not the democratically governed island that Beijing claims as its own territory. <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/topic/taiwan/"">Taiwan</a> rejects China&#8217;s territorial claims.</p>



<p>The six security sources said Tang would visit Hawaii, home of the US Indo-Pacific Command, for a Pacific Fleet change-of-command ceremony. Three of them said Tang was then expected to attend the April 8 to 10 Sea-Air-Space conference near Washington and that talks were under way to arrange a meeting with the US chief of naval operations, Admiral Lisa Franchetti.</p>



<p>The sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity given the trip&#8217;s sensitivity.</p>



<p>Taiwan&#8217;s navy and the Pentagon declined to comment.</p>



<p>Unlike visits to the US by senior officials from allies like Japan and Britain, conducted openly, those of Taiwanese officials, especially military, are kept low key and often not officially confirmed.</p>



<p>Washington and Taipei have had no official diplomatic or military relationship since 1979, when the US switched recognition to Beijing, though the United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.</p>



<p>China has not renounced the use of force to take Taiwan, where the defeated Republic of China government fled in 1949 after it lost China&#8217;s civil war to Mao Zedong&#8217;s Communists, who established the People&#8217;s Republic of China.</p>

<p>Matias, who holds a Ph.D., is the youngest among the group of scientist awardees which include <a href=""http://s-of-planet-earth-awards"">Dr. S. Faizi from India</a>, Dr. James Hansen from the United States, Dr. Kimberly Nicholas from Sweden, Dr. Jamie Pittock from Australia, and Dr. Fernando Valladares from Spain.</p>



<p>The award acknowledges individuals who champion life on Earth and demonstrate exceptional creativity or contributions in their work in science-based advocacy with the public, policymakers, or other non-scientist groups seeking solutions to environmental challenges. The nominees went through a rigorous screening process.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-charting-a-course"">Charting a course</h5>



<p>Growing up in Pasig, Metro Manila, Matias recalled that she always had an acute awareness of the value of the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She was president of her high school’s Eco Team club and thought “science was cool.” But when the time came to enroll for a college course, conferred with a BPI Foundation scholarship, she was surprised to find that Environmental Science was not on the list of courses she could take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matias decided on the next best thing: a biology course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She knew that, unlike most of her peers, she didn’t want to become a medical doctor. So she subsequently pursued a master&#8217;s degree in environmental science at the University of the Philippines while working for Greenpeace Southeast Asia but soon succumbed to the perils that many who try to pursue higher education while working professionally in the Philippines.</p>



<p>While working at UP-Diliman’s Marine Science Institute, Matias started to seriously consider a career in the academe, thanks to Dr. Arturo Lluisma, a principal investigator who introduced her to the rigors of research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She earned an International Climate Protection Fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, then a scholarship to finish her MSc in Environmental Sciences and Policy from the Central European University in Hungary. She was awarded a PhD in Agricultural Sciences from the Center for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn in Germany in 2017.</p>



<p>She received a European Science Award from the Eiselen Foundation and Foundation Fiat Panis in 2018 for her doctoral dissertation entitled <em>Sustainability of Community Forestry Enterprises: Indigenous Wild Honey Gathering in the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve, Palawan, Philippines</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a work borne of her engagement in fieldwork with various Philippine nongovernmental organizations, including the Non-Timber Forest Products Exchange Programme (NTFP-EP Asia). She found out from the indigenous Tagbanua community that they had a problem with honey gathering in Aborlan, Palawan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She subsequently carried out a project with the community to help restore giant honey bee habitat by planting native species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, she, with Loreta Alsa, a Tagbanua, went to Yale University to present the project and they were awarded first place by Yale’s International Society of Tropical Forests for the Innovation Prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Giving back</h5>



<p>“I always look for a way to give back,” she said. She recounted how she would actively raise funds after extreme emergency events in the Philippines by making handmade items, especially with recycled paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit the Philippines in 2013, for example, she sold products at a Christmas market in Germany to raise funds for relief aid.</p>



<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, she solicited donations through her Instagram account (@thegreenitch) for NTFP-EP Philippines and sent handcrafted notepads to donors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these served as her way to contribute to her country even if she was physically away.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to build a career by using people, especially since I conduct research with indigenous communities,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For her current research project on Palawan pangolins, she is helping several Filipinos by giving them access to information, training, and opportunities that are not, sadly, available to most Filipino scientists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She said, “We need to advance science because, at the moment, it exists in a silo. There is limited interaction with the social sciences and the humanities. In Germany, interdisciplinary approaches are encouraged and promoted, and they are supported with research grants.”</p>



<p>Matias, a tenured Filipino professor in Germany, currently serves as a member of the Selection Committee of the International Climate Protection Fellowship, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; lead author of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Thematic Assessment of the Interlinkages among Biodiversity, Water, Food and Health (Nexus Assessment); and senior fellow of the Manila Observatory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something that she heard Dr. Jurgenne Honculada-Primavera, a mangrove ecosystem scientist, say has been her north star: “We need science-based development.”</p>

But when the time came to enroll for a college course, conferred with a BPI Foundation scholarship, she was surprised to find that Environmental Science was not on the list of courses she could take.       Matias decided on the next best thing: a biology course.       She knew that, unlike most of her peers, she didn't want to become a medical doctor. So she subsequently pursued a master's degree in environmental science at the University of the Philippines while working for Greenpeace Southeast Asia but soon succumbed to the perils that many who try to pursue higher education while working professionally in the Philippines.      While working at UP-Diliman's Marine Science Institute, Matias started to seriously consider a career in the academe, thanks to Dr. Arturo Lluisma, a principal investigator who introduced her to the rigors of research.       She earned an International Climate Protection Fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, then a scholarship to finish her MSc in Environmental Sciences and Policy from the Central European University in Hungary. She was awarded a PhD in Agricultural Sciences from the Center for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn in Germany in 2017.      She received a European Science Award from the Eiselen Foundation and Foundation Fiat Panis in 2018 for her doctoral dissertation entitled  Sustainability of Community Forestry Enterprises: Indigenous Wild Honey Gathering in the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve, Palawan, Philippines .       It was a work borne of her engagement in fieldwork with various Philippine nongovernmental organizations, including the Non-Timber Forest Products Exchange Programme (NTFP-EP Asia). She found out from the indigenous Tagbanua community that they had a problem with honey gathering in Aborlan, Palawan.       She subsequently carried out a project with the community to help restore giant honey bee habitat by planting native species.       In 2018, she, with Loreta Alsa, a Tagbanua, went to Yale University to present the project and they were awarded first place by Yale's International Society of Tropical Forests for the Innovation Prize.        Giving back      ""I always look for a way to give back,"" she said. She recounted how she would actively raise funds after extreme emergency events in the Philippines by making handmade items, especially with recycled paper.       After Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit the Philippines in 2013, for example, she sold products at a Christmas market in Germany to raise funds for relief aid.      During the COVID-19 pandemic, she solicited donations through her Instagram account (@thegreenitch) for NTFP-EP Philippines and sent handcrafted notepads to donors.       All these served as her way to contribute to her country even if she was physically away.      ""I don't want to build a career by using people, especially since I conduct research with indigenous communities,"" she said.       For her current research project on Palawan pangolins, she is helping several Filipinos by giving them access to information, training, and opportunities that are not, sadly, available to most Filipino scientists.       She said, ""We need to advance science because, at the moment, it exists in a silo. There is limited interaction with the social sciences and the humanities. In Germany, interdisciplinary approaches are encouraged and promoted, and they are supported with research grants.""      Matias, a tenured Filipino professor in Germany, currently serves as a member of the Selection Committee of the International Climate Protection Fellowship, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; lead author of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Thematic Assessment of the Interlinkages among Biodiversity, Water, Food and Health (Nexus Assessment); and senior fellow of the Manila Observatory.       Something that she heard Dr. Jurgenne Honculada-Primavera, a mangrove ecosystem scientist, say has been her north star: ""We need science-based development.""      ""How can you do proper science if your needs are not met? Science is not a priority in the Philippines. But I hope it will be,"" she said. -  Rappler.com   ",Positive

<p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore had requested the $60 million earlier on Friday, and within hours the US Department of Transportation&#8217;s Federal Highway Administration approved the request to fund emergency work.</p>



<p>Such funding typically takes days, but President Joe Biden told reporters on Tuesday he directed the federal government to &#8220;move heaven and earth&#8221; to quickly rebuild the bridge, which forms part of a highway looping around Baltimore.</p>

<p>But first a team of experts must assess how to remove the stuck vessel, loaded with thousands of containers and trapped by bridge debris. The US Army Corps of Engineers was bringing in the largest crane on the Eastern Seaboard to remove pieces of bridge, Moore said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Dali is almost as long as the Eiffel Tower and the Dali has the Key Bridge on top of it. We&#8217;re talking 3,000 or 4,000 tons of steel that&#8217;s sitting on top of that ship,&#8221; Moore said.</p>

2629617,opinion-big-defeat-for-big-tech-project-syndicate,[OPINION] A big defeat for Big Tech,"
<p>NEW YORK – Last year, US President Joe Biden’s administration infuriated lobbyists representing Big Tech firms and others that profit from our personal data by denouncing a proposal that would have gutted domestic data privacy, online civil rights and liberties, and competition safeguards. Now, Biden’s new <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/02/28/executive-order-on-preventing-access-to-americans-bulk-sensitive-personal-data-and-united-states-government-related-data-by-countries-of-concern/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">executive order</a> on Americans’ data security reveals that the lobbyists had good reason to worry.</p>



<p>After decades of data brokers and tech platforms exploiting Americans’ personal data without any oversight or restrictions, the Biden administration has announced that it will ban the transfer of certain kinds of data to China and other countries of concern. It is a small, but important, step toward protecting Americans’ sensitive personal information, in addition to government-related data.</p>



<p>Moreover, the order is likely a precursor to additional policy responses. Americans are rightly worried about what is happening online, and their concerns extend well beyond privacy violations to a host of other digital harms, such as mis- and disinformation, social media-induced teenage anxiety, and racial incitement.</p>



<p>The firms that make money from our data (including personal medical, financial, and geolocation information) have spent years trying to equate “free flows of data” with free speech. They will try to frame any Biden administration public-interest protections as an effort to shut down access to news websites, cripple the internet, and empower authoritarians. That is nonsense.</p>



<p>Tech companies know that if there is an open, democratic debate, consumers’ concerns about digital safeguards will easily trump concerns about their profit margins. Industry lobbyists thus have been busy trying to short-circuit the democratic process. One of their methods is to press for obscure trade provisions aimed at circumscribing what the United States and other countries can do to protect personal data.</p>



<p>It might seem obvious that a US president should protect Americans’ privacy and national security, both of which could be jeopardized depending on how and where the vast amounts of data that we all generate are processed and stored. Yet, amazingly, former President Donald Trump’s administration&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bilaterals.org/IMG/pdf/wto_plurilateral_ecommerce_stocktake_text.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">sought to prohibit</a>&nbsp;the US from placing any restrictions on “the cross-border transfer of information, including personal information” to<em>&nbsp;any country</em>&nbsp;if such transfers were related to the business of any investor or service provider operating in the US or other countries signing the agreement.</p>



<p>The Trump administration’s proposal to include this rule in the World Trade Organization did provide for one exception, which ostensibly would allow some regulation “necessary to achieve a legitimate public policy objective,” but it was designed not to work in practice. While Big Tech lobbyists cite the exception to rebut criticism of the broader proposal, the provision’s language comes straight from a WTO “General Exception” that has failed in&nbsp;<a href=""https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.OMdVzV-2FN-2FjMvjjQtI3xB4u0cgxf7KhzC-2F-2FA1uBqXPiA4zPH-2FnoC-2BzQwHbFgIeutVVXliomTQfGUZZcODFw0GIoJ-2BZLnUu8AoyOSIRA4GaneCkf-2FUvMMZlhtcPbPHmI1mjZQp_MPntofsD8N2zaEQmbO9-2B1sgxkbNuPR1UI1CjulzlaNlO-2BTbsv4Z22g6yg5vCVjPkvyih2yJ9KUY4VTjZkpYvOeOQsJv4RU-2BAjxkwu4M794WE6UC7v0KyIp5z6Byqb5fWq5AnBlpcxrjd9trY7j7cmFYgFh0Y9sP19jyAsBCRuLUr-2Fvs4OIAbcc-2BZ17Kl0UlWm6sXiOYewNDG9nuQQ9wCFpQkaVtV3Jg77yEVdA3JnlKELsvmnN9p7zl-2B4PYRcbgq8szb8mKp3-2FWRv4emUTQG4mwml7EpkB6LNvG6WVJ2DhK0-2B87qX2wVUC4p1XUKxo1vmi0DAoDFHAclX9xMvLYrO2rA73HiM1CE6geAF03Me-2B7-2FagAB9VvyFUysUmAX1iMK"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">46 of 48 attempted uses</a>.</p>



<p>The ban on cross-border data regulation was just one of four proposals that Big Tech lobbyists convinced Trump officials to slip into the revised North American Free Trade Agreement and to propose at WTO-related talks. Written in arcane jargon and buried among hundreds of pages of trade-pact language, these provisions were misleadingly branded as “digital trade” rules.</p>



<p>By prohibiting governments from adopting certain policies, the proposal’s industry-written terms threatened bipartisan efforts in the US Congress to counter Big Tech’s abuses of consumers, workers, and smaller businesses. They also undercut the US regulatory agencies responsible for protecting our privacy and civil rights, and for enforcing antitrust policy. In fact, had the Trump-era rules banning government restrictions on data flows gone into effect at the WTO, they would have barred the Biden administration’s own new data-security policy.</p>



<p>Few people realized the Trump-era proposal even existed – except, of course, for the lobbyists who had been quietly commandeering trade talks. While no previous US trade pacts had included provisions pre-empting executive and congressional authority over data regulation, digital platforms suddenly would have been granted special secrecy rights. The kinds of algorithmic assessments and AI pre-screenings that Congress and executive-branch agencies deem critical to protecting the public interest would have been banned.</p>



<p>After Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, industry lobbyists still hoped to make these anomalous rules a new norm. Their plan was to get the same provisions added to a Biden administration agreement called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. But instead of going with the lobbyists, Biden administration officials worked with Congress to determine that the Trump-era proposals were not compatible with congressional and administration goals for digital privacy, competition, and regulation.</p>



<p>Now, we can understand why tech lobbyists were so incensed by the Biden administration’s decision to withdraw support for the Trump-era proposal. They recognized that by casting aside Big Tech’s favored “digital trade” handcuffs, the Biden administration was reasserting its authority to regulate the large platforms and data brokers that Americans across the political spectrum think have too much power. Trade agreements have gotten a bad name precisely because of this kind of behavior by corporate lobbyists.</p>



<p>The US needs a robust debate about how best to regulate Big Tech, and over how to maintain competition while preventing the digital harms that are stoking political polarization and undermining democracy. Obviously, the debate should not be tethered by constraints imposed surreptitiously by Big Tech through trade agreements. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai is exactly right when she&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwT5GfbxTMY&amp;t=186s"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">says</a>&nbsp;that it would be “policy malpractice” to lock in trade rules limiting action on these matters before the US government has established its own domestic approach.</p>



<p>Whatever one’s position on the regulation of Big Tech – whether one believes that its anti-competitive practices and social harms should be restricted or not – anyone who believes in democracy should applaud the Biden administration for its refusal to put the cart before the horse. The US, like other countries, should decide its digital policy democratically. If that happens, I suspect the outcome will be a far cry from what Big Tech and its lobbyists were pushing for. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>The World Court on Thursday, March 28, unanimously ordered Israel, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/south-africa-files-genocide-case-against-israel-international-court-justice/"">accused by South Africa of genocide in Gaza</a>, to take all necessary and effective action to ensure basic food supplies to the enclave&#8217;s Palestinian population and halt spreading <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/gaza-suffers-famine-level-shortages-mass-death-imminent-march-2024/"">famine</a>.</p>



<p>But Gaza&#8217;s Hamas rulers said a ceasefire was needed to halt the humanitarian crisis.</p>



<p>The order from the International Court of Justice came as Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters battled in close combat around Gaza&#8217;s Al Shifa Hospital, where the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they attacked Israeli soldiers and tanks with rockets and mortar fire.</p>



<p>Judges at the court said the people in the coastal enclave face worsening conditions.</p>



<p>&#8220;The court observes that Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine (…) but that famine is setting in,&#8221; the judges said in their order.</p>



<p>The new measures were requested by South Africa as part of its <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/explainer-genocide-case-against-israel-international-court-of-justice/"">case</a> that accuses Israel of state-led genocide in Gaza.</p>



<p>Senior Hamas official Basem Naim said the ruling did not go far enough and Israel must be ordered to end its military offensive to halt the suffering.</p>



<p>&#8220;We welcome any new demands to end this humanitarian tragedy in Gaza and especially in the northern Gaza Strip, but we hoped the court ordered a ceasefire as an absolute solution to all the miseries our people in Gaza are living through,” Naim told Reuters.</p>



<p>The UN Security Council voted on Tuesday to <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/united-nations-security-council-demands-ceasefire-gaza-march-2024/"">demand an immediate ceasefire</a> and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. The United States abstained from, but did not veto, the vote.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Israel&#8217;s Foreign Ministry on the World Court ruling. Israel has said it is making efforts to expand access for humanitarian groups to Gaza overland, through air drops and by ship.</p>



<p>Israeli leaders have said Hamas can end the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/topic/israel-hamas-war/"">war</a> by surrendering, freeing all hostages it holds in Gaza and handing over for trial those involved in the October 7 attack.</p>



<p>The Israeli army said it continued to operate around the Al Shifa Hospital complex in Gaza City after storming it more than a week ago. Its forces had killed around 200 gunmen since the start of the operation &#8220;while preventing harm to civilians, patients, medical teams, and medical equipment&#8221;, it said.</p>



<p>In a televised statement, chief Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said troops operating at the hospital killed Raed Thabet, a Hamas quartermaster whom he described as one of the group&#8217;s 10 most senior members.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-shortages-of-food-water-and-medicine"">Shortages of food, water and medicine</h5>



<p>Gaza&#8217;s health ministry said wounded people and patients were being held inside an administration building in Al Shifa that was not equipped to provide them with healthcare. Five patients had died since the Israeli raid began due to shortages of food, water and medical care, the Hamas-run ministry said.</p>



<p>Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Gaza Hamas-run government media office, said the Israeli army was carrying out &#8220;field killings and executions against hundreds of civilians&#8221;, when asked about the army statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone inside the Shifa complex are civilians, and there are no military personnel inside the compound,&#8221; he told Reuters.</p>



<p>Al Shifa, the Gaza Strip&#8217;s biggest hospital before the war, had been one of the few healthcare facilities even partially operational in north Gaza before the latest fighting. It had also been housing displaced civilians.</p>



<p>Unverified footage on social media showed its surgery unit blackened by flames and nearby apartments on fire or destroyed.</p>



<p>The armed wings of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant groups said in a statement they &#8220;bombed, with a barrage of mortar shells, gatherings of Israeli soldiers in the vicinity of the Al-Shifa Complex&#8221; in a joint operation.</p>



<p>Israel says it is targeting Hamas militants who use civilian buildings, including apartment blocks and hospitals, for cover. Hamas denies doing so.</p>



<p>At least 32,552 Palestinians have been killed and 74,980 wounded in Israel&#8217;s military offensive in the Gaza Strip since October 7, the territory&#8217;s health ministry said on Thursday.</p>



<p>Thousands more dead are believed to be buried under rubble and more than 80% of Gaza&#8217;s 2.3 million population is displaced, many at risk of famine.</p>



<p>The war erupted after Hamas militants broke through the border and rampaged through communities in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 253 hostages according to Israeli tallies.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Two more hospitals besieged</h5>



<p>In Rafah, where more than a million people have been sheltering, health officials said an Israeli airstrike on a house killed at least 12 people.</p>



<p>Israel says it plans a ground offensive into Rafah, in the far south of the enclave, where it believes most Hamas fighters are now sheltering. Its closest ally and main arms supplier the United States opposes such an assault, arguing it would cause too much harm to civilians who have sought refuge there.</p>



<p>Israeli forces also continued to blockade Al-Amal and Nasser hospitals in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, while several other areas came under Israeli fire, residents said.</p>

<p class=""has-text-align-center""><strong>READ:</strong> <strong>Part 1 | <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/environment/critical-facilities-risk-flooding-sipalay-city-negros-occidental/"">Flood-prone lifelines: Critical facilities at risk of flooding in Negros Occidental town</a> &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class=""has-drop-cap"">NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – In Sipalay, critical facilities such as health facilities and schools were built in flood-prone areas. The local government is aware of this, yet these facilities have not been relocated even after being devastated during past disasters.</p>



<p>In the first part of this investigation, Rappler found that over half of Negros Occidental residents are at high risk of danger due to floods. Across the province, Sipalay ranked high among towns, with the most critical facilities constructed in flood-prone areas. At least three in 10 of these are located in vulnerable areas.</p>



<p>Negros Occidental also ranked 11th out of 84 provinces in terms of exposure to multiple hazard risks, the 2021 <a href=""https://www.pdc.org/wp-content/uploads/NDPBA-PHL-Province-Profile-New-Merged-compressed.pdf"">Philippine Province Risk Profiles</a> of Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) said.</p>



<p>During Typhoon Odette (Rai), Sipalaynons experienced firsthand how taking refuge in schools that double as evacuation centers can still expose them to flood risks. For them, it was a wake-up call. But for the local government, it didn&#8217;t appear to be enough.</p>



<p>Sipalay officials plan to construct two evacuation centers and relocate a few schools, but the relocation of all critical facilities away from flood-prone areas remains a challenge. Experts said that moving them out of flood zones is a complex process, and finding a solution that checks all the boxes takes time.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-officials-aware-of-flood-risks"">Officials aware of flood risks</h5>



<p>Months of analysis by the state hazard assessment portal HazardHunterPH data showed that Sipalay has the most number of schools among Negros Occidental towns with a very high risk of flooding. In the Philippines, schools serve as evacuation centers during disasters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sipalay City government said it is aware of the flood risks.</p>



<p>As part of pre-disaster meetings, the local government unit (LGU) uses government hazard maps from the environment department’s Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) and follows warnings from state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Administration (PAGASA). They identify areas that might be affected and stock food and other necessities in those barangays.</p>



<p>Days before Odette hit, city officials said all the necessary preparations were made, save for mandatory evacuation. For them, it was the “lack” of information dissemination on the part of village officials and the reluctance of the residents to evacuate and listen to warnings that cost lives.</p>



<p>“The barangay was nowhere to be found, to be honest. They are part of the warning system but they are too lazy, probably,” Sipalay City Mayor Gina Lizares said.</p>



<p>Locals interviewed by Rappler confirmed that some of them knew about Odette’s strength due to the announcements made by the city government and the village officials, while others said they were not informed by the barangay beforehand.</p>

<p>At Sipalay City National High School (SCNHS), the designated evacuation center in Barangay V in the city proper, floodwaters reached the ground floor of the school, prompting evacuees to seek refuge on the second floor of the building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sipalay officials said that the Sipalay City gymnasium, a larger facility located in the center of the city proper, was also used as an evacuation center. Both the city gym and SCNHS are located in a very high-risk flood zone.</p>



<p>Towns with a high risk of floods may be submerged in one to two meters of water for over three days, according to the MGB. For most Filipinos, this is already waist- to chest-deep. Those with a very high susceptibility to floods may see more than two meters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As far as I know, flood-prone schools are not used as evacuation centers. They are usually brought to our covered courts and gymnasiums. Even if there’s flooding in that area, the gym is more protected,” Lizares said. Her staff confirmed the flood did not reach the city gym.</p>



<p>Since Odette, village officials have been advised to not use the evacuation centers located within their barangays, especially for expected major disasters. Instead, they were told to evacuate to the facility in Gil Montilla in central Sipalay which would be safer, according to disaster officials. Gil Montilla is where the city’s new government center was built.</p>



<p>“What we wanted to instill in the barangays is no matter what the weather condition might look, if PAGASA says the typhoon will be disastrous, they shouldn’t be complacent. They must do what they need to do,” the city’s Public Safety Officer Dionilo Bogtae said.</p>



<p>The city government also moved to strengthen the village disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) offices by conducting more training so that they would be able to fend for themselves if the unimaginable happens.</p>



<p>“We know that the [city] DRRMO can only handle a few [areas] when it comes to disaster. Remote areas should know how to handle themselves,” Sipalay City Information Officer James Lim said. “During Odette, the rescuers were here and they could not access the barangays. They could not access the roads going to remote areas because of the debris in the flood.”</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Moving schools out of harm’s way</h5>



<p>Odette hit at a time when the Philippines was still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>By the end of 2022, Sipalay had already used up around three-fourths of its disaster funds. The mayor said the main expenditure that year was the response to the aftermath of Odette, on top of expenses related to the pandemic. Then, Severe Tropical Storm Paeng (Nalgae) hit the city in late 2022.</p>



<p>Data from the Commission on Audit showed that Sipalay spent P56.6 million out of its P72.3 million ($1.3 million)* worth of disaster funds in 2022. Of the budget, the city spent around P800 ($14) per resident. Sipalay had the highest disaster spending per resident among LGUs in Negros Occidental – almost thrice the provincial average of about P260 ($5) in 2022.</p>



<iframe title=""How much does Negros Occidental spend per person on DRRM?"" aria-label=""Column Chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-8lTJc"" src=""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8lTJc/15/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""926"" data-external=""1""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>



<p>While this is considered a relatively high utilization rate, Lizares said their aim is to spend even more of their disaster funds in the coming years – at least 80% compared to the current 78% utilization rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“During [the COVID-19 pandemic], we were very focused. We wanted to see to it that we are proactive, not reactive. So we used the funds for the things we foresaw that we’d need in the future during that time,” Lizares said.</p>



<p>Sipalay officials told Rappler the city aims to relocate a few of the schools being used as evacuation centers because of the risks. But Lim said that the city is facing land ownership issues in the process.</p>



<p>Cabadiangan National High School is among the schools eyed for relocation to a “higher elevation.” The high school, despite being in a “safe” location, according to state hazard maps, is close to flood zones that may block residents' access to roads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high school is located in the barangay that saw the most deaths during Odette.</p>

<p>Lim said the city has been looking for landowners who may want to sell land. Officials also explored another site, but they need approval from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources since part of the area falls within forest land.</p>



<p>For other flood-prone schools, the information officer said the city is still looking for new sites for their relocation.</p>



<p>As for SCNHS, Lizares said it would be moved to a different location not because of flood risk but because the lot it occupies belongs to Barangay V Elementary School.</p>



<p>“The only reason we are planning to move [SCNHS] out of there is because two schools in one area are too crowded. When it (elementary school) expands, we need the bigger area that is already occupied by the high school,” the Sipalay mayor said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Relocation: A complex process</h5>



<p>In the Philippines, evacuation centers, health facilities, and schools built in flood zones are more common than you think.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335445955_EVALUATION_OF_THE_SPATIAL_DISTRIBUTION_OF_EVACUATION_CENTERS_IN_METRO_MANILA_PHILIPPINES"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2019 peer-reviewed study</a> found that almost half of all evacuation centers in Metro Manila are also at risk of floods. The researchers of the study recommended “reevaluating” the locations of evacuation centers to facilitate prompt disaster response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do exactly that, disaster risk management experts told Rappler that the government needs to face several hurdles to move critical facilities to safety.</p>



<p>The operations center director of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), an organization that serves as coordinator for DRRM activities for the private sector, said there are many considerations in relocating evacuation centers – relocation costs are one thing, finding new locations is another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For a country that is at the top for natural hazard exposure, it may be challenging to identify a suitable location for these facilities that also meet necessary criteria such as proximity to the community, public transport accessibility, connection to basic amenities, among others,” PDRF’s Arnel Capili told Rappler.</p>



<p>Capili has decades of experience in disaster risk management. He used to be the regional director of the Department of National Defense’s Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol from 1997 to 2007.</p>



<p>According to him, relocation involves logistical challenges that, if not addressed properly, can lead to delays. And a country that is exposed to multiple hazards, including an average of 20 typhoons a year, cannot afford delays.</p>



<p>“Relocation is indeed a complex process, hence, moving forward, it is important for the government to get things right from the start by conducting a thorough risk assessment in selecting sites for new facilities, including working with experts to incorporate resilient design features,” Capili said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ricardo Jalad, ex-OCD administrator and former executive director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, pointed out that relocation “depends on the resources available and the priorities of the office concerned.”</p>



<p>Under the <a href=""https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2010/05/27/republic-act-no-10121/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">law</a>, LGUs must allocate at least 5% of their revenues to the local disaster fund. Ideally, the wealthier a city is, the higher its disaster funds. Jalad suggested that the national government come in because all critical facilities that it constructs are put under strict evaluation by the RDRRMC.</p>



<p>“Maybe [the Department of Public Works and Highways] should include in their annual budget the relocation of critical facilities like schools, evacuation centers, and health facilities from no-build areas to safe areas,” Jalad said.</p>



<p>The former NDRRMC chief pointed out that, ultimately, it comes down to whether local governments will take decisive action.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a matter of political will on the part of the LGUs on the enforcement of their comprehensive land use plans (CLUP) and related powers like issuance of building permits [when building new schools],” said Jalad.</p>



<p>Under Republic Act No. 7976 or the Local Government Code, LGUs are mandated to have CLUPs and keep them updated. In a <a href=""https://dhsud.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/Publication/Guidebooks/HLURB_CLUP_Vol_1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">guide</a> created by the former Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, the precursor to the housing department, LGUs are encouraged to analyze risks for areas that may be affected by hazards. Land zoning recommendations could range from implementing a no-build zone for a specific area to managing risks instead.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Building evacuation centers can be costly</h5>



<p>If the relocation of critical facilities is too complex a problem, why not build new ones then?</p>



<p>According to Capili, the national government should set “broad” policies and regulations related to the identification of the sites for construction, and safety standards, among others. Local governments should localize such policies to their needs, ensure that these are followed, and make specific decisions regarding site selection, design, and construction.</p>



<p>In the case of Sipalay, the mayor also does not think relocating schools in the city proper would be wise. “The whole poblacion (city proper) is at high risk, so why just move the schools?”</p>



<p>The mayor said that the city is building two evacuation centers for Sipalaynons –&nbsp;one at Gil Montilla and one in the city proper. Construction of the P16.9-million ($305,000) evacuation center in Gil Montilla <a href=""https://digicastnegros.com/p16-9-m-evac-center-to-rise-in-sipalay-city/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">started</a> in December 2020. It is still ongoing.</p>



<p>Capili agrees that building new evacuation centers may be better than relocation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is probably more practical to construct new evacuation centers that satisfy current building codes, aligned with standards [such as] PWD (persons-with-disability) access, lactation rooms, et cetera, and more importantly, away from hazards that may potentially impact its safety.”</p>



<p>In March 2023, the House of Representatives approved on third and final reading <a href=""https://hrep-website.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/legisdocs/first_19/CR00351.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">House Bill No. 7354</a>, which seeks to mandate every city and municipality to have at least one permanent evacuation center that is up to par with national government and international standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=19&amp;q=HBN-7354"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">counterpart measure</a> at the Senate has passed the committee level but has yet to be taken up at the plenary.</p>



<p>According to the House bill, permanent evacuation centers must be designed to withstand wind speeds of at least 300 kilometers per hour (km/h) and earthquakes of at least magnitude 8. To put this requirement in context, Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) had maximum sustained winds of 315 km/h, while the strongest earthquake that hit the Philippines was the magnitude-8 Moro Gulf quake in 1976.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from structural requirements, the bill also proposes that the new facilities be well-ventilated, have a large capacity, and have amenities such as sleeping quarters, one shower and one toilet per 20 persons, and food preparation areas, among others.</p>



<p>It comes with a hefty price tag for the national government, eyed by Congress to be the sole financier for this ambitious undertaking.</p>



<p>In a <a href=""https://cpbrd.congress.gov.ph/images/PDF%20Attachments/Discussion%20Paper/DP2023-04_Estimating_the_Cost_of_Establishing_an_Evacuation_Center_in_Every_City_and_Municipality_final.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">discussion paper</a>, the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department (CPBRD) in the lower chamber estimated that building a two-story evacuation center for each of the over 500 cities and municipalities in the country would require P33.4 billion ($602 million), or an average of P64.8 million ($1.17 million) per building, aside from the price of land where it would be built. </p>



<p>The policy research office used Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) costing for a 2019 evacuation center project and computed for 2022 prices.</p>



<p>The CPBRD noted that the total amount needed to finance the program would be a huge expenditure for the national government – plus, the DPWH has a track record of having a weak absorptive capacity, or its inability to efficiently spend money to complete projects without delay.</p>



<p>In CPBRD’s estimates, a new evacuation center in Western Visayas, the region where Negros Occidental is located, would cost around P62.6 million ($1.13 million), which is easily about 90% of Sipalay’s total disaster funds in 2022.</p>



<p>In contrast, the evacuation center at Gil Montilla being built by the Sipalay City government is around two-thirds less expensive. PDRF also told Rappler that it built multipurpose facilities that serve as evacuation centers during disasters at P25 million ($451,000) each, which is half the price of the CPBRD’s estimate.</p>



<p>If the bill is passed, the policy research office recommends that the government explore other financing options for this program, including climate financing or partnerships with the private sector. It also said it would slash costs if the LGU donated land for the evacuation center.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">‘Demand investments in preparedness’</h5>



<p>Experts agree that investing in preparedness goes a long way than focusing resources on response. Capili noted, however, that investments in preparedness or DRR are “not that visible” to the public.</p>



<p>The disaster risk expert noted that investment in preparedness comes with a good early warning system, robust emergency communication system, and evacuation centers built according to standards.</p>



<p>“To make matters worse, they (long-term investments) can be more costly and more time-consuming –&nbsp;beyond the 3-year term of locally-elected officials,” Capili said.</p>



<p>Take Sipalay’s evacuation center as an example. Construction in Gil Montilla started in late 2020 and has been ongoing for over three years now, outliving the pandemic and the last local election in 2022.</p>



<p>Capili said that residents should start demanding higher investments in disaster preparedness from their local governments.</p>



<p>“What is more important is to highlight the long-term benefits from investments in preparedness and DRR rather than a short-term dole-out mentality.… By doing so, governments can minimize the costs associated with recovery and rehabilitation, and more importantly, families can now shelter in place,” he said.</p>



<p>More than two years after Odette, Sipalaynons still have vivid memories of their harrowing experience during the typhoon.</p>



<p>Looking back, Felizardo dela Cruz, a Cabadiangan resident whose house was swept away by floods with him in it, said that he would have evacuated to a safer place if the Sipalay government had asked him to.</p>



<p>Narcisso Biasong, whose wife and grandchild died after trying to seek shelter from the raging typhoon, resented the city government. “I was sleepless after Odette.… When someone asks her (mayor) how is Sipalay, she just answers, ‘We’re okay.’ Is it really ‘okay’ if many people died?”</p>



<p>While the issues with evacuation centers are being discussed by the government, many Filipinos – not just in Sipalay – will have no choice but to continue putting their lives at stake by depending on these high-risk critical facilities every time a disaster hits the country. –&nbsp;<strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

The local government is aware of this, yet these facilities have not been relocated even after being devastated during past disasters.      In the first part of this investigation, Rappler found that over half of Negros Occidental residents are at high risk of danger due to floods. Across the province, Sipalay ranked high among towns, with the most critical facilities constructed in flood-prone areas. At least three in 10 of these are located in vulnerable areas.      Negros Occidental also ranked 11th out of 84 provinces in terms of exposure to multiple hazard risks, the 2021  Philippine Province Risk Profiles  of Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) said.      During Typhoon Odette (Rai), Sipalaynons experienced firsthand how taking refuge in schools that double as evacuation centers can still expose them to flood risks. For them, it was a wake-up call. But for the local government, it didn't appear to be enough.      Sipalay officials plan to construct two evacuation centers and relocate a few schools, but the relocation of all critical facilities away from flood-prone areas remains a challenge. Experts said that moving them out of flood zones is a complex process, and finding a solution that checks all the boxes takes time.      Officials aware of flood risks      Months of analysis by the state hazard assessment portal HazardHunterPH data showed that Sipalay has the most number of schools among Negros Occidental towns with a very high risk of flooding. In the Philippines, schools serve as evacuation centers during disasters.       The Sipalay City government said it is aware of the flood risks.      As part of pre-disaster meetings, the local government unit (LGU) uses government hazard maps from the environment department's Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) and follows warnings from state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Administration (PAGASA). They identify areas that might be affected and stock food and other necessities in those barangays.      Days before Odette hit, city officials said all the necessary preparations were made, save for mandatory evacuation. For them, it was the ""lack"" of information dissemination on the part of village officials and the reluctance of the residents to evacuate and listen to warnings that cost lives.      ""The barangay was nowhere to be found, to be honest. They are part of the warning system but they are too lazy, probably,"" Sipalay City Mayor Gina Lizares said.      Locals interviewed by Rappler confirmed that some of them knew about Odette's strength due to the announcements made by the city government and the village officials, while others said they were not informed by the barangay beforehand.        LAZY. Sipalay City Mayor Gina Lizares claims that city officials did their part to prepare Sipalaynons for Odette, calling village officials ‘lazy' for allegedly not doing enough to warn residents. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler.com       At Sipalay City National High School (SCNHS), the designated evacuation center in Barangay V in the city proper, floodwaters reached the ground floor of the school, prompting evacuees to seek refuge on the second floor of the building.       Sipalay officials said that the Sipalay City gymnasium, a larger facility located in the center of the city proper, was also used as an evacuation center. Both the city gym and SCNHS are located in a very high-risk flood zone.      Towns with a high risk of floods may be submerged in one to two meters of water for over three days, according to the MGB. For most Filipinos, this is already waist- to chest-deep. Those with a very high susceptibility to floods may see more than two meters.       ""As far as I know, flood-prone schools are not used as evacuation centers. They are usually brought to our covered courts and gymnasiums. Even if there's flooding in that area, the gym is more protected,"" Lizares said. Her staff confirmed the flood did not reach the city gym.      Since Odette, village officials have been advised to not use the evacuation centers located within their barangays, especially for expected major disasters. Instead, they were told to evacuate to the facility in Gil Montilla in central Sipalay which would be safer, according to disaster officials. Gil Montilla is where the city's new government center was built.      ""What we wanted to instill in the barangays is no matter what the weather condition might look, if PAGASA says the typhoon will be disastrous, they shouldn't be complacent. They must do what they need to do,"" the city's Public Safety Officer Dionilo Bogtae said.      The city government also moved to strengthen the village disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) offices by conducting more training so that they would be able to fend for themselves if the unimaginable happens.      ""We know that the [city] DRRMO can only handle a few [areas] when it comes to disaster. Remote areas should know how to handle themselves,"" Sipalay City Information Officer James Lim said. ""During Odette, the rescuers were here and they could not access the barangays. They could not access the roads going to remote areas because of the debris in the flood.""      Moving schools out of harm's way      Odette hit at a time when the Philippines was still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.      By the end of 2022, Sipalay had already used up around three-fourths of its disaster funds. The mayor said the main expenditure that year was the response to the aftermath of Odette, on top of expenses related to the pandemic. Then, Severe Tropical Storm Paeng (Nalgae) hit the city in late 2022.      Data from the Commission on Audit showed that Sipalay spent P56.6 million out of its P72.3 million ($1.3 million)* worth of disaster funds in 2022. Of the budget, the city spent around P800 ($14) per resident. Sipalay had the highest disaster spending per resident among LGUs in Negros Occidental - almost thrice the provincial average of about P260 ($5) in 2022.                While this is considered a relatively high utilization rate, Lizares said their aim is to spend even more of their disaster funds in the coming years - at least 80% compared to the current 78% utilization rate.       ""During [the COVID-19 pandemic], we were very focused. We wanted to see to it that we are proactive, not reactive. So we used the funds for the things we foresaw that we'd need in the future during that time,"" Lizares said.      Sipalay officials told Rappler the city aims to relocate a few of the schools being used as evacuation centers because of the risks. But Lim said that the city is facing land ownership issues in the process.      Cabadiangan National High School is among the schools eyed for relocation to a ""higher elevation."" The high school, despite being in a ""safe"" location, according to state hazard maps, is close to flood zones that may block residents' access to roads.       The high school is located in the barangay that saw the most deaths during Odette.        POST-ODETTE. Learning from Odette, Sipalay City Information Officer James Lim says that city officials are in the process of improving disaster mitigation of the city, including plans to relocate several flood-prone schools. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler       The plan to relocate the Cabadiangan public school has been ongoing, and the city has already discussed its plan with the Department of Education (DepEd).      Lim said the city has been looking for landowners who may want to sell land. Officials also explored another site, but they need approval from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources since part of the area falls within forest land.      For other flood-prone schools, the information officer said the city is still looking for new sites for their relocation.      As for SCNHS, Lizares said it would be moved to a different location not because of flood risk but because the lot it occupies belongs to Barangay V Elementary School.      ""The only reason we are planning to move [SCNHS] out of there is because two schools in one area are too crowded. When it (elementary school) expands, we need the bigger area that is already occupied by the high school,"" the Sipalay mayor said.

<p>NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – Unknown to people, John Lennon&#8217;s song &#8220;Imagine&#8221; was vital in the creation of Negros Occidental&#8217;s youngest town of Don Salvador Benedicto – or DSB to many – 41 years ago.</p>



<p>This is a hush-hush truth only revealed recently by philanthropist 71-year-old Cynthia Jagurin-de la Cruz, also a former activist and politician, during the seventh death anniversary of her late husband, former political prisoner and politician Nehemias &#8220;Nene&#8221; de la Cruz on March 26.</p>



<p>The couple was known as founders of the frontier situated in the midst of North Negros Natural Park (NNNP), 49.8 kilometers east of the capital, Bacolod City.</p>



<p>DSB, formerly, dubbed as the &#8220;Land of Chaos&#8221; or &#8220;Mindanao of Negros&#8221; had a turnaround  transformation into a &#8220;Summer Capital&#8221; of Negros Island.</p>



<p>Situated 2,346 feet above sea level and spanning 170.50-square kilometers, DSB now is the land of posh upland resorts, majestic and enchanted falls, cool weather, pineapple and pine tree plantations hence hailed by the Department of Tourism in Western Visayas as the No. 1 tourist destination in Negros.</p>



<p>But how and why did it become a frontier town of Negros Occidental.</p>



<p>Rappler was privileged to talk to Madam Cynthia during the death anniversary of her husband and, for the first time, in a no-holds-barred interview, she detailed &#8220;bits and pieces&#8221; of DSB history then and now with them as founders.</p>



<p>Everybody knows Nene and Cynthia were former student activists in one of the universities in Bacolod who, later, went underground, fought against the government, became lovers and later husband-and-wife while in the movement.</p>



<p>But when Nene was captured and put in jail, things gradually changed.</p>



<p>Being a political prisoner, Cynthia said, her husband got a dream of creating a town out of the &#8220;cradle of insurgency/rebellion&#8221; in Negros.</p>



<p>It was an &#8220;infamous&#8221; dream, she said, that no one believed, worse, called Nene as a &#8220;rootless dreamer.&#8221;</p>



<p>It &#8220;pained&#8221; Cynthia who, at that time, was pregnant with their first child, Laurence Marxlen, now the incumbent mayor of DSB.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Syempre, bilang asawa, suportahan ko gid ang akon bana</em>, (Of course, as a wife, I need to support my husband)&#8221; Cynthia said</p>

<p>After Nene&#8217;s back-and-forth journey in jail (for three times), he met Colonel Mike Coronel, the Philippine Constabulary (PC) director in Negros Occidental and later as regional director in Western Visayas that time.</p>



<p>Nene and Coronel became friends, and so he was privileged to state his dream of creating a town right there and then in the &#8220;nest of insurgents.&#8221;</p>



<p>From 1976 to 1984, the struggles (literally and figuratively), said Cynthia, were immense.</p>



<p>Cynthia and Nene became the &#8220;father-and-mother&#8221; figure for the poor, oppressed, and even insurgents from the  seven villages of DSB now that formerly belonged to the towns of Murcia and Calatrava and San Carlos City before.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every time, there were encounters, we hauled the dead from the mountains to funeral parlors, the wounded to the hospital and we paid everything. We looked for money just to shoulder everything and everything,&#8221; she told Rappler.</p>



<p>We also fought against almost all kinds of criminal like robbers, murderers, among others that hid in the secluded areas in DSB, she said.<br><br>But fed up with this scenario, Cynthia said Nene thought of something that could entice mountain people to abandon underground movement, go back to the fold of government and live peacefully.</p>



<p>What a timing then that Nene, a music lover himself and was fascinated with the 1971 John Lennon song &#8220;Imagine.&#8221;</p>



<p>The lyrics, said Cynthia, were so relevant and meaningful for Nene&#8217;s &#8220;unreachable dream.&#8221;</p>



<p>She even sang the stanza of the song: &#8220;Imagine there&#8217;s no heaven&#8230;&#8221; which, she said, more than inspired Nene to follow his dream of creating a town.</p>



<p>Nene then let &#8220;Imagine&#8221; be heard by everyone in the mountains, but in order to be understood by the natives, he and Cynthia made efforts to translate the English lyrics to Hiligaynon.</p>



<p>And it bore goodness until they realized their dream when then-president Ferdinand E. Marcos declared DSB as a town on February 9, 1983 pursuant to Batas Pambansa (BP) Bilang 336.</p>



<p>But why DSB, Cynthia said, because it&#8217;s an honor for Don Salvador Benedicto, one of the pillars of the revolutionary government in Negros who fought against the Japanese Imperial Army that invaded Negros during the World War II .</p>



<p>And the center of this revolutionary government was in the mountain barangay of Igmaya-an, formerly in Murcia but now, the capital of DSB.</p>



<p>In 1984, when DSB was given an internal revenue allotment IRA of only P7,000. </p>



<p>Nene, the first appointed mayor, worked harder to  further realize all his &#8220;wishes&#8221; for DSB, which he called as their &#8220;second baby&#8221; next to their eldest &#8211; Laurence Marxlen – the incumbent DSB mayor. They founded DSB before their next two children were born. </p>



<p>As fate would have it,  in 1984, the Oscar-winning movie &#8220;The Killing Fields&#8221; had Lennon&#8217;s song for its   theme.</p>



<p>Cynthia said the movie further inspired Nene.</p>



<p>So, he used this as a material via film showing in every of the seven barangays in DSB, furthering his quest to let people understand that peace is really valuable in living their dream to have a progressive community soonest.</p>



<p>And so, Nene&#8217;s dream through &#8220;Imagine&#8221; didn&#8217;t go to waste.</p>



<p>Rather, Cynthia, stresses, no one imagined that DSB would reach its peak now just because of the song &#8220;Imagine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thus, as she marked her husband&#8217;s seventh death anniversary on March 26 with a memorial Mass at the grave of Nene, she could not help but imagine her lover, her &#8220;rock&#8221; that once became an &#8220;<em>alipin</em>&#8221; of his &#8220;unreacheable dream.&#8221;</p>



<p>But, Cynthia said, thanks to &#8220;Imagine&#8221; – the beginning of everything for DSB&#8217;s history was fulfilled truly beyond imagination. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>Some of the young boys played around the souvenir whip on the street while others participated in beating flagellants once they reached the village&#8217;s <em>Pabasa ng Pasyon</em> (Chanting of the Passion).</p>



<p>The residents said the boys who joined in whipping were usually relatives of the <em>mandarame</em>, while those who played with the whip would only amuse themselves in the act.</p>



<p>“You cannot take part in the beating if the flagellant doesn&#8217;t know you. The boys come here with the flagellants,” Jenny, a resident looking over at the <em>Pabasa</em>, said.</p>

<p>The local church, Santa Teresita Parish, incorporates the discussions on <em>Cuaresma</em> traditions through homilies and conversations. Church coordinator and liturgist Nikko Ramos said the parishioners, even non-Roman Catholic faithfuls, must remember the Holy Week traditions with respect.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s <em>panata</em> not fun-nata. Definitely we are going to look deeply into the tradition. <em>May gabay dapat. Nabigla nga ako sa video kasi first time kong makita na may bata,</em>” Ramos said. “<em>Hindi natin alam anong opinion ng parent niya dito, pero nakita natin na nilagyan din ng dugo, parang lumalabas na pinaglalaruan ang tradition.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s “panata” not “fun-nata.” Definitely we are going to look deeply into the tradition. There should be guidance. I was surprised to see the video because it&#8217;s my first time to see a kid. We don&#8217;t know what the opinions of his parents but we also see here that they smeared him with blood. It looked like the tradition is being played with.)</p>



<p>The boy&#8217;s back was smeared with his flagellant uncle&#8217;s blood. Photos of him after the event, shared with Rappler, showed the boy didn&#8217;t have bruises or sores. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-part-of-panata"">Part of panata?</h5>



<p>Maryanne, not her real name, also bought a souvenir whip for her five-year old son to stop him from crying.</p>



<p>Maryanne, who lives in nearby Barangay Pampang, said she would encourage his son to self-flagellate when he grows older. She said self-flagellation had been part of their family&#8217;s “<em>panata</em>” (vow).</p>



<p>Luisito Castillo, 53, has been selling bamboo whips along the streets on the way to the village&#8217;s <em>Pabasa</em>. He said he wasn&#8217;t able to sell souvenir whips as they had been selling fast.</p>



<p>A souvenir whip costs P150 to P200 along the streets of the barangay. While the larger whip used for self-flagellation costs P500 to P750.</p>



<p><em>“Ing pamamyalung palaspas ena man malyari. Balu da yan. Pero nung ing anak mamyalung la mu, normal na mu yan keni. Emi no man ren abawal ren, aliwa naman ikami ing kayi (pengari),”</em> Castilo, who is also a Catholic, said.</p>



<p><em>“Deng kasing anak emi no man abawal. Unti yan dininan de pang daya, ena man masanting. Ena man pyalung yan,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>(Playing as one of the flagellants is not allowed. They know that. But if it&#8217;s the children who are playing, that is normal here. We can&#8217;t stop them. We are not the parents. We can&#8217;t just stop the children. Like that in the video, they even added blood, it is not good. This is not a game.)</p>



<p>Castillo has been selling bamboo whips every year before joining the Good Friday penitents self-flagellating. For Castillo, this has been his devotion every year as a Catholic and for his children.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-begin-with-parents"">Begin with parents</h5>



<p>Mechelle Hallili, Lourdes Northwest Elementary School teacher, said the discipline and respect of the tradition should begin at home and through the parents.</p>



<p>Being one of the elementary teachers in the village, she admits how challenging it is to teach the parents on how to discipline their children.</p>



<p>“Kasi <em>patche ing anak penganyan ne at ali me entabayanan, kailangan sabyanan me na apin ing tradisyon, respetuwan ta ya. Pero ali dapat as pyalung kasi itang simbolu na papakit ta ya. Pero most of the parents nowadays karin magkayi ing negligence da. Ali de aexplain masalese nanu ing tradisyon ta,</em>&#8221; Halili said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Medyu masakit na talnan ta la o sabyanan ta la reng pengari. Turu ta la mu na ali ya pyalung at ede lalako ing respetu keng tradisyon,”</em>&nbsp;she aded.</p>



<p>(Because if a child did the flagellation and without guidance, there should be someone to tell them that this is our tradition and we should respect it. That this is not a game because we are trying to show the symbol. However, here lies the negligence from most of the parents. They cannot explain properly what our tradition is. It is quite challenging to hold the parents or reprimand them. Let&#8217;s just teach them that this is not a game, don&#8217;t lose the respect.)</p>



<p>The Angeles City government reconvened the Local Council for Protection of Children (LCPC) to revisit and strengthen the city’s policies on child protection. </p>



<p>The existing policies and procedures concerning child welfare and protection will be thoroughly reviewed and implemented to supplement the guidance at the local level for the youth.&nbsp;<strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

We don't know what the opinions of his parents but we also see here that they smeared him with blood. It looked like the tradition is being played with.)      The boy's back was smeared with his flagellant uncle's blood. Photos of him after the event, shared with Rappler, showed the boy didn't have bruises or sores.       Part of panata?      Maryanne, not her real name, also bought a souvenir whip for her five-year old son to stop him from crying.      Maryanne, who lives in nearby Barangay Pampang, said she would encourage his son to self-flagellate when he grows older. She said self-flagellation had been part of their family's "" panata "" (vow).      Luisito Castillo, 53, has been selling bamboo whips along the streets on the way to the village's  Pabasa . He said he wasn't able to sell souvenir whips as they had been selling fast.      A souvenir whip costs P150 to P200 along the streets of the barangay. While the larger whip used for self-flagellation costs P500 to P750.       ""Ing pamamyalung palaspas ena man malyari. Balu da yan. Pero nung ing anak mamyalung la mu, normal na mu yan keni. Emi no man ren abawal ren, aliwa naman ikami ing kayi (pengari),""  Castilo, who is also a Catholic, said.       ""Deng kasing anak emi no man abawal.

But if it's the children who are playing, that is normal here. We can't stop them. We are not the parents. We can't just stop the children. Like that in the video, they even added blood, it is not good. This is not a game.)      Castillo has been selling bamboo whips every year before joining the Good Friday penitents self-flagellating. For Castillo, this has been his devotion every year as a Catholic and for his children.      Begin with parents      Mechelle Hallili, Lourdes Northwest Elementary School teacher, said the discipline and respect of the tradition should begin at home and through the parents.      Being one of the elementary teachers in the village, she admits how challenging it is to teach the parents on how to discipline their children.      ""Kasi  patche ing anak penganyan ne at ali me entabayanan, kailangan sabyanan me na apin ing tradisyon, respetuwan ta ya. Pero ali dapat as pyalung kasi itang simbolu na papakit ta ya. Pero most of the parents nowadays karin magkayi ing negligence da.

Turu ta la mu na ali ya pyalung at ede lalako ing respetu keng tradisyon,""  she aded.      (Because if a child did the flagellation and without guidance, there should be someone to tell them that this is our tradition and we should respect it. That this is not a game because we are trying to show the symbol. However, here lies the negligence from most of the parents. They cannot explain properly what our tradition is. It is quite challenging to hold the parents or reprimand them. Let's just teach them that this is not a game, don't lose the respect.)      The Angeles City government reconvened the Local Council for Protection of Children (LCPC) to revisit and strengthen the city's policies on child protection.       The existing policies and procedures concerning child welfare and protection will be thoroughly reviewed and implemented to supplement the guidance at the local level for the youth.  - Rappler.com   ",Neutral

<p class=""has-drop-cap"">BUTUAN, Philippines – In the Philippines, where typhoons, earthquakes, and other natural hazards are a grim reality, social media has become a double-edged sword.</p>



<p>Frontline government agencies in the disaster-prone Caraga region, like the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), agree that while social media can be a vital tool for spreading life-saving advisories, it can also serve as a breeding ground for false information that sows confusion and impedes disaster response.</p>



<p>Ver Lancer Galanda, chief meteorological officer of PAGASA-Butuan, said they have lost count of the false reports they have received through Messenger and Facebook regarding typhoons, despite no credible threats being monitored.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fake news like this can create panic and fear. With social media, we can&#8217;t avoid this since information spreads quickly,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The most recent disaster that occurred in Caraga was the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/surigao-del-sur-earthquake-december-2-2023/"">Magnitude 7.4 offshore earthquake </a>in Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur, on December 2, 2023. The calamity was not spared from false information, prompting newsrooms to debunk claims.</p>



<p>Rappler fact-checked the misrepresentation of <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/old-photos-used-earthquake-lights-surigao-del-sur/"">old “earthquake lights” photos</a> in Surigao del Sur. The post claimed to show flashes of light in the sky during an earthquake, supposedly occurring in Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur after the December 2 quake.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1150"" height=""1208"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/false-post-hinatuan-quake-december-2023.png?fit=1024%2C1024"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2630304"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/false-post-hinatuan-quake-december-2023.png?resize=1150%2C1208&amp;zoom=1 1150w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/false-post-hinatuan-quake-december-2023.png?resize=1150%2C1208&amp;zoom=0.5 575w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/false-post-hinatuan-quake-december-2023.png?resize=1150%2C1208&amp;zoom=0.25 288w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1150px) 100vw, 1150px"" /></figure>



<p>However, three of the photos used in the post were not from Hinatuan nor from that year – the images were taken from photos and videos captured in India and Mexico in 2015 and 2017, respectively. The fourth photo in the post, while taken in Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur, depicted coastal waters receding in an unspecified area following the December 2 quake.</p>



<p>One News PH also fact-checked a claim about the discovery of a “shokoy,” a mythical human-like sea creature there.</p>



<p>Days later, the Davao-based online newsgroup <a href=""https://mindanews.com/top-stories/2023/12/fact-check-no-magnitude-7-2-earthquake-no-tsunami-hit-mindanao-last-december-6/"">MindaNews debunked false reports</a> of a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and tsunami supposedly hitting Mindanao on December 6.</p>



<p>Lina, not her real name, a resident of Barangay Aquino in Hinatuan, set up a makeshift tent on higher ground with her family three days after the earthquake, enduring the cold night and insect bites instead of staying in her house.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our house was not damaged, but I am still afraid for my family because of the posts on Facebook mentioning that a big tsunami will happen anytime,” she said.</p>



<p>While the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) released an advisory on a tsunami alert right after the earthquake, it announced around 3 am on December 3 that the tsunami warning had been lifted, and no further warnings were issued afterwards.</p>

<p>Four days after the earthquake, social media buzzed with a claim suggesting that five active underwater volcanoes in Hinatuan triggered the quake. However, <a href=""https://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/phivolcs-davao-refutes-disinformation-shared-online?fbclid=IwAR3ZHISkMrL45Y8he70oTajskbxibFbpWXEMmdka2jKNy7OGQYjtYqA_Cqo#google_vignette"">Phivolcs-Davao quickly debunked this</a>, showing how such false information can provoke mass hysteria and anxiety.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-unreliable-source"">Unreliable source</h5>



<p>Besides Phivolcs, the state agency offering updates during earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, there&#8217;s The Watchmen’s Earth and Space Connection. With 1.1 million Facebook followers and 867,009 likes, its popularity might imply reliability, but a geologist has cautioned against its credibility.</p>



<p>On December 5, 2023, three days after the earthquake in Hinatuan, the page posted that the “Manila trench and Philippine trench are moving,” garnering 23,600 reactions, 19,200 shares, and 1,400 comments, with most pleading for divine mercy and protection</p>



<p>For Jonel Dalona, a Caraga-based geologist, it wasn’t the first case, as he and his colleagues had already debunked this Facebook page many times before.</p>



<p>“For several years now, my fellow geologists and I have been debunking this page. The earthquakes in the Philippines are normal, and there is no reason to panic. The convergence of plates happens daily, and this process takes millions of years,” Dalona said.</p>



<p>He reminded netizens through a Facebook post not to believe in that page and follow advice from government agencies only since they have studied the matter for years, unlike the page in question, which relies solely on mere Google searches.</p>



<p>One of those who shared the content was Marjolyn Barcenilla, a resident of Trento, Agusan del Sur. She said that upon reading the post, she felt alarmed as it was her first time to experience multiple aftershocks.</p>



<p>“You know, when you are in that kind of situation, it feels like everything people say is taken as fact,&#8221; Barcenilla said. She added that she was swayed by the significant number of reactions to the post, and the presentation of photos and captions heightened the alarming nature of the information.</p>



<p>With a bio note, “This page is for reports on earthquakes, solar flares, and all space activity that affects our Earth,” it is managed by five people, two of whom are from the Philippines. The page has a history of being fact-checked by Rappler during the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/249500-lava-come-out-fissures-taal-volcano-eruption-january-2020/"">Taal Volcano eruption in January 2020</a>.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-politics-and-propaganda"">Politics and propaganda</h5>



<p>While false information may create panic and fear, another aspect of it could also be used to foster distrust in the government&#8217;s relief efforts after the disaster, as acknowledged by officials of Dinagat and Surigao del Norte provinces.</p>



<p>Top officials in these two hardest-hit provinces in Mindanao, where <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/weather/typhoon-odette-pagasa-forecast-december-16-2021-2pm/"">Typhoon Odette (Rai) made landfall on December 16, 2021</a>, attributed the circulating disinformation during the disaster response to political ambitions, given that it occurred five months before the 2022 national and local elections.</p>

<p>Jeff Crisostomo, former information officer and provincial government spokesperson of Dinagat Island, took to Facebook on January 10, 2022, and declared that the information about the then-governor Arlene “Kaka” Bag-ao ordering a lockdown amid the devastation of Odette, was false and intended to hinder the flow of relief operations and recovery initiatives.</p>



<p>On March 31, 2022, just three months after Odette, the Provincial Information Office of Dinagat called out a certain Carl Brian Gonzaga, who claimed that donated relief goods were mishandled and disposed of by the provincial government. Gonzaga also alleged that Army soldiers were not treated well, and so they no longer distributed food to the needy in the island province.</p>

<p>The PIO rebutted such claims, stating all relief goods were distributed properly via the local government or directly to communities, all information was provided on its Facebook page, and public documents were available at the Provincial Emergency Operations Center.</p>



<p>The Dinagat PIO said at that time: “While we are now in the campaign period for local elections, we believe that free discourse is important when it comes to issues related to governance. That is part of democracy. What is not part of this is creating and sharing false information and hearsay. Let us leave politics in the campaign and not in the regular business of governance and service to the people. Dinagatnons deserve better.”</p>



<p>On December 23, 2021, Surigao del Norte 1st District Representative Francisco Jose “Bingo” Matugas II addressed allegations that donated relief items were held and stored at the command centers in Dapa Port and Sayak Airport in Del Carmen instead of immediately distributed to victims. Such charges implied that the items were repackaged to falsely claim credit for the relief goods.</p>



<p>“Fake news harms the actual work that is being done. It destroys the public’s trust in the government’s communication relays and its coordination tasks. It threatens the relationships being built between the public and private sectors. In the end, it harms both the relief workers and the people who desperately need relief,” he said.</p>



<p>Ella, who requested not to be named, said that among the deciding factors for her vote were the posts circulating online about the local government’s inefficiencies after Odette.</p>



<p>“Their reign (Matugas) has been long, but after Odette, they seemed absent. I&#8217;ve read many posts circulating about how incompetent they are. Somehow, Odette made us realize who should be voted for,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>In the 2022 elections, officials like Bag-ao in Dinagat and members of the Matugas political dynasty, including the then-Surigao del Norte governor Francisco Matugas, the then-Surigao City mayor Ernesto Matugas Jr. and his father and vice mayor Ernesto Sr., lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only Matugas victors for key positions in the province are Francisco’s wife Sol who won as mayor of General Luna town, and son and namesake Francisco Jose II, who secured a representative’s seat.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-volunteer-relief"">Volunteer relief</h5>



<p>Michael Piencenaves, who was involved in organizing relief efforts for Odette survivors, pointed to Facebook posts that suggested using Siargao&#8217;s backdoor for relief efforts due to the alleged confiscation of relief goods at the Dapa Port. The relief items were supposedly given to selected beneficiaries.</p>



<p>“Those rumors led to us choosing a direct boat trip to Halian, Del Carmen, instead of Dapa and shipping our goods to Del Carmen directly. Of course, at that moment, we didn&#8217;t have time to check and verify information given the emergency and various other considerations, so we did what we had to based on limited info,” Piencenaves said.</p>

<p>Richmond Seladores, a volunteer in the relief efforts in Siargao, said the disinformation only worsened the situation in the field.</p>



<p>“It was hard on the ground, and the false information coming in didn’t help at all. It was disheartening because we’re all exhausted, sleep-deprived, and with the issues on social media, it somehow undermined our efforts,” Seladores said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-improper-allocation"">Improper allocation</h5>



<p>Liza Mazo, Office of Civil Defense-Caraga director, said false information primarily leads to panic, resulting in uncoordinated and inefficient responses which contribute to unnecessary fear and strain limited resources during evacuations.</p>



<p>She recalled a troubling situation where residents, influenced by a Facebook post and forwarded Messenger text, hastily evacuated, despite heavy rain, following an earthquake in Cagwait, Surigao del Sur in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mazo said some had children with them. Phivolcs subsequently said there was no tsunami threat.</p>



<p>“Some even called the barangay to request evacuation. At that time, the vehicles and personnel were limited as they were still distributing relief goods. But still, they went there and evacuated them, when the priority should have been on the relief aid distribution, not on evacuation, as there was no tsunami threat to begin with,” Mazo said.</p>



<p>Mazo said that while people need to verify information sources, she also emphasized that it is the government&#8217;s responsibility to provide information and education campaigns (IEC) for disaster preparedness.</p>



<p>“We need to empower those at the barangay levels because they have direct access to the communities. IECs should include guidance on which agencies to rely on during disasters like PAGASA, Phivolcs, and legitimate media sources to prevent panic and unnecessary fear,&#8221; she said. – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

Days later, the Davao-based online newsgroup  MindaNews debunked false reports  of a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and tsunami supposedly hitting Mindanao on December 6.      Lina, not her real name, a resident of Barangay Aquino in Hinatuan, set up a makeshift tent on higher ground with her family three days after the earthquake, enduring the cold night and insect bites instead of staying in her house.      ""Our house was not damaged, but I am still afraid for my family because of the posts on Facebook mentioning that a big tsunami will happen anytime,"" she said.      While the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) released an advisory on a tsunami alert right after the earthquake, it announced around 3 am on December 3 that the tsunami warning had been lifted, and no further warnings were issued afterwards.        DANGER. Fearful of a tsunami striking at night, a family parks their vehicle along the national highway of Hinatuan town in Surigao del Sur after a strong earthquake struck in December 2023.       Four days after the earthquake, social media buzzed with a claim suggesting that five active underwater volcanoes in Hinatuan triggered the quake. However,  Phivolcs-Davao quickly debunked this , showing how such false information can provoke mass hysteria and anxiety.      Unreliable source      Besides Phivolcs, the state agency offering updates during earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, there's The Watchmen's Earth and Space Connection. With 1.1 million Facebook followers and 867,009 likes, its popularity might imply reliability, but a geologist has cautioned against its credibility.      On December 5, 2023, three days after the earthquake in Hinatuan, the page posted that the ""Manila trench and Philippine trench are moving,"" garnering 23,600 reactions, 19,200 shares, and 1,400 comments, with most pleading for divine mercy and protection      For Jonel Dalona, a Caraga-based geologist, it wasn't the first case, as he and his colleagues had already debunked this Facebook page many times before.      ""For several years now, my fellow geologists and I have been debunking this page. The earthquakes in the Philippines are normal, and there is no reason to panic. The convergence of plates happens daily, and this process takes millions of years,"" Dalona said.      He reminded netizens through a Facebook post not to believe in that page and follow advice from government agencies only since they have studied the matter for years, unlike the page in question, which relies solely on mere Google searches.      One of those who shared the content was Marjolyn Barcenilla, a resident of Trento, Agusan del Sur. She said that upon reading the post, she felt alarmed as it was her first time to experience multiple aftershocks.      ""You know, when you are in that kind of situation, it feels like everything people say is taken as fact,"" Barcenilla said. She added that she was swayed by the significant number of reactions to the post, and the presentation of photos and captions heightened the alarming nature of the information.      With a bio note, ""This page is for reports on earthquakes, solar flares, and all space activity that affects our Earth,"" it is managed by five people, two of whom are from the Philippines. The page has a history of being fact-checked by Rappler during the  Taal Volcano eruption in January 2020 .      Politics and propaganda      While false information may create panic and fear, another aspect of it could also be used to foster distrust in the government's relief efforts after the disaster, as acknowledged by officials of Dinagat and Surigao del Norte provinces.      Top officials in these two hardest-hit provinces in Mindanao, where  Typhoon Odette (Rai) made landfall on December 16, 2021 , attributed the circulating disinformation during the disaster response to political ambitions, given that it occurred five months before the 2022 national and local elections.        SURIGAO ODETTE. A survivor of Odette holds a placard asking for food relief along the national highway of Surigao City on Christmas Day. Photo by Ivy Marie Mangadlao       Jeff Crisostomo, former information officer and provincial government spokesperson of Dinagat Island, took to Facebook on January 10, 2022, and declared that the information about the then-governor Arlene ""Kaka"" Bag-ao ordering a lockdown amid the devastation of Odette, was false and intended to hinder the flow of relief operations and recovery initiatives.      On March 31, 2022, just three months after Odette, the Provincial Information Office of Dinagat called out a certain Carl Brian Gonzaga, who claimed that donated relief goods were mishandled and disposed of by the provincial government. Gonzaga also alleged that Army soldiers were not treated well, and so they no longer distributed food to the needy in the island province.        PUNTA BILAR DEVASTATION. A view of the devastation caused by Odette in Barangay Punta Bilar, Surigao City. Photo by Ivy Mangadlao       The PIO rebutted such claims, stating all relief goods were distributed properly via the local government or directly to communities, all information was provided on its Facebook page, and public documents were available at the Provincial Emergency Operations Center.      The Dinagat PIO said at that time: ""While we are now in the campaign period for local elections, we believe that free discourse is important when it comes to issues related to governance. That is part of democracy. What is not part of this is creating and sharing false information and hearsay. Let us leave politics in the campaign and not in the regular business of governance and service to the people. Dinagatnons deserve better.""      On December 23, 2021, Surigao del Norte 1st District Representative Francisco Jose ""Bingo"" Matugas II addressed allegations that donated relief items were held and stored at the command centers in Dapa Port and Sayak Airport in Del Carmen instead of immediately distributed to victims. Such charges implied that the items were repackaged to falsely claim credit for the relief goods.      ""Fake news harms the actual work that is being done. It destroys the public's trust in the government's communication relays and its coordination tasks. It threatens the relationships being built between the public and private sectors. In the end, it harms both the relief workers and the people who desperately need relief,"" he said.      Ella, who requested not to be named, said that among the deciding factors for her vote were the posts circulating online about the local government's inefficiencies after Odette.      ""Their reign (Matugas) has been long, but after Odette, they seemed absent. I've read many posts circulating about how incompetent they are. Somehow, Odette made us realize who should be voted for,"" she said.      In the 2022 elections, officials like Bag-ao in Dinagat and members of the Matugas political dynasty, including the then-Surigao del Norte governor Francisco Matugas, the then-Surigao City mayor Ernesto Matugas Jr. and his father and vice mayor Ernesto Sr., lost.       The only Matugas victors for key positions in the province are Francisco's wife Sol who won as mayor of General Luna town, and son and namesake Francisco Jose II, who secured a representative's seat.      Volunteer relief      Michael Piencenaves, who was involved in organizing relief efforts for Odette survivors, pointed to Facebook posts that suggested using Siargao's backdoor for relief efforts due to the alleged confiscation of relief goods at the Dapa Port. The relief items were supposedly given to selected beneficiaries.      ""Those rumors led to us choosing a direct boat trip to Halian, Del Carmen, instead of Dapa and shipping our goods to Del Carmen directly. Of course, at that moment, we didn't have time to check and verify information given the emergency and various other considerations, so we did what we had to based on limited info,"" Piencenaves said.        DEVASTATION IN SIARGAO. An aerial file photo captures the massive devastation wrought by Typhoon Odette in General Luna town in Siargao Island, Surigao del Norte. Photo by Erwin Mascarinas       Richmond Seladores, a volunteer in the relief efforts in Siargao, said the disinformation only worsened the situation in the field.      ""It was hard on the ground, and the false information coming in didn't help at all. It was disheartening because we're all exhausted, sleep-deprived, and with the issues on social media, it somehow undermined our efforts,"" Seladores said.      Improper allocation      Liza Mazo, Office of Civil Defense-Caraga director, said false information primarily leads to panic, resulting in uncoordinated and inefficient responses which contribute to unnecessary fear and strain limited resources during evacuations.      She recalled a troubling situation where residents, influenced by a Facebook post and forwarded Messenger text, hastily evacuated, despite heavy rain, following an earthquake in Cagwait, Surigao del Sur in December 2023.       Mazo said some had children with them. Phivolcs subsequently said there was no tsunami threat.      ""Some even called the barangay to request evacuation. At that time, the vehicles and personnel were limited as they were still distributing relief goods. But still, they went there and evacuated them, when the priority should have been on the relief aid distribution, not on evacuation, as there was no tsunami threat to begin with,"" Mazo said.      Mazo said that while people need to verify information sources, she also emphasized that it is the government's responsibility to provide information and education campaigns (IEC) for disaster preparedness.      ""We need to empower those at the barangay levels because they have direct access to the communities. IECs should include guidance on which agencies to rely on during disasters like PAGASA, Phivolcs, and legitimate media sources to prevent panic and unnecessary fear,"" she said. -  Rappler.com        Ivy Marie Mangadlao is a community journalist writing for Mindanews and an Aries Rufo Journalism fellow for 2023-2024.

<p><strong>The facts</strong>: The 1:49-minute video uses footage from two different sources, and both are not connected with any recent military drill related to the disputed maritime area between Thailand and Cambodia, as claimed.</p>



<p>The first 14 seconds of the clip are sourced from a YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHNuGbWMlWc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">video</a> by &#8220;S.

It shows the trucks being transported from Phitsanulok province to the southern Nakorn Sri Thammarat, not around Trad province.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the original video was posted three years ago, not recently as claimed.</p>



<p>The remaining part of the TikTok video, which appears to depict an army exercise, was sourced from a 2022 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wbgLoKH76M"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">video</a> on the YouTube channel &#8220;LM Channel,&#8221; boasting over 133,000 followers.</p>



<p>The YouTube video shows military exercises concerning the tactical operations of tank units and training as a battalion unit for 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Row over Koh Kood Island: </strong>The TikTok video was posted as the issue of overlapping claims in the Gulf of Thailand was brought into the limelight once again after the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia <a href=""https://www.nationthailand.com/thailand/policies/40035368"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">reopened discussions</a> during their talk in Bangkok in February 2024. </p>

<p>In 2001, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding, agreeing to negotiate the maritime border and jointly develop petroleum resources. However, no significant progress was made until the <a href=""https://www.thansettakij.com/business/economy/587938"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">recent talks in February</a>.</p>



<p>These talks gave rise to concerns that Koh Kood island, a popular tourist destination, may be <a href=""https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2024/03/09/how-has-koh-kood-become-a-thai-cambodia-political-issue/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">used as a bargaining chip</a> in negotiations.

<p>JAKARTA, Indonesia – Indonesia&#8217;s parliament on Thursday, March 28, designated special status for Jakarta, keeping the metropolis as the country&#8217;s economic epicenter, amid plans to move the capital city to Borneo island.</p>

<p>The city is a flagship project of outgoing President Joko Widodo, who pledged to redistribute wealth and development currently concentrated in Java, across the archipelago.</p>



<p>An &#8220;agglomeration&#8221; council will be created to harmonize development plans between Jakarta and its satellite cities, according to a copy of the new law dated March 18 seen by Reuters.</p>



<p>Home Affairs Minister Tito Karnavian said after deliberation in parliament that Jakarta should still be improved to compete with other &#8220;world-class cities&#8221; once the seat of government has been moved to Nusantara.</p>



<p>&#8220;After it&#8217;s no longer a capital, it still has to be sealed with a special status so that it can accelerate economic growth and to increase contribution to the country&#8217;s GDP,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Under current rules, Jakarta will remain Indonesia&#8217;s capital until the president issues a decree officially naming Nusantara as the new capital, which is expected sometime this year.</p>

2630131,explainer-why-baltimore-bridge-collapse-death-toll,EXPLAINER: Why did the Baltimore bridge collapse and what is the death toll?,"
<p>Divers <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-updates-march-28-2024/"">recovered</a> the remains&nbsp;of two of the six missing workers more than a day after a cargo ship smashed into&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-updates-march-26-2024/"">Baltimore&#8217;s Francis Scott Key Bridge</a>. The bodies of two men were found in a red pickup truck submerged in the icy waters of the Patapsco River. Rescuers pulled two workers from the water alive on Tuesday, and one was hospitalized.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-when-did-the-baltimore-bridge-collapse"">When did the Baltimore bridge collapse?</h5>



<p>Shortly after 1 am EDT&nbsp;(0500 GMT), a container ship named the Dali was sailing down the Patapsco River on its way to Sri Lanka. At 1:24 am, it suffered a total power failure and all its lights went out.</p>



<p>Three minutes later, at 1:27 am, the container ship struck a pylon of the bridge, crumpling almost the entire structure into the water.</p>



<p>The bridge was up to code and there were no known structural issues, Maryland Governor Wes Moore said.</p>



<p>Tuesday&#8217;s disaster may be the worst US bridge collapse since 2007, when a design error caused the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis to plunge into the Mississippi River, killing 13 people.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">What is the death toll so far?</h5>



<p>The two men whose bodies were recovered on Wednesday were identified as Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, of Baltimore, originally from Mexico, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, of nearby Dundalk, originally from Guatemala.</p>

The bodies of two men were found in a red pickup truck submerged in the icy waters of the Patapsco River. Rescuers pulled two workers from the water alive on Tuesday, and one was hospitalized.      When did the Baltimore bridge collapse?      Shortly after 1 am EDT (0500 GMT), a container ship named the Dali was sailing down the Patapsco River on its way to Sri Lanka. At 1:24 am, it suffered a total power failure and all its lights went out.      Three minutes later, at 1:27 am, the container ship struck a pylon of the bridge, crumpling almost the entire structure into the water.      The bridge was up to code and there were no known structural issues, Maryland Governor Wes Moore said.      Tuesday's disaster may be the worst US bridge collapse since 2007, when a design error caused the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis to plunge into the Mississippi River, killing 13 people.      What is the death toll so far?      The two men whose bodies were recovered on Wednesday were identified as Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, of Baltimore, originally from Mexico, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, of nearby Dundalk, originally from Guatemala.      The six workers, who are presumed dead, came from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, according to a press conference.

2630072,missing-environmental-activists-pangasinan-found-safe,&#8216;Bruised but alive&#8217;: Missing environmental activists in Pangasinan found safe,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – The two missing environmental activists, who were reported abducted in Pangasinan, were found safe, according to a fact-finding team formed by progressive groups. </p>



<p>&#8220;After three days, environmental activists-church workers <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/groups-call-release-environmental-activists-abducted-pangasinan/"">Francisco &#8220;Eco” Dangla III and Joxelle &#8220;Jak” Tiong</a> are no longer in the hands of their abductors, bruised but alive. While they are still reeling from their harrowing ordeal, we hope that in due time, Eco and Jak will be able to fully recount the details of their abduction and subsequent release,&#8221; the fact-finding team said on Thursday, March 28. </p>



<p>Based on reports, Dangla and Tiong were abducted in Pangasinan on March 24. Witnesses said they saw two men who were forced to board an SUV on the evening of March 24 in Barangay Polo, San Carlos City, Pangasinan.  </p>



<p>At the time, the two activists were convenors of the Pangasinan People’s Strike for the Environment, &#8220;who vocally defended the people and ecosystems of Pangasinan against the harms of coal-fired power plants, nuclear power plants, incinerator plants, and offshore mining in Lingayen Gulf,&#8221; the fact-finding team said. Prior to their abduction, Dangla and Tiong were <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/list-times-term-red-tagging-use-united-nations-legislators-philippines/"">red-tagged</a>, according to the Kalikasan People&#8217;s Network for the Environment. </p>



<p>&#8220;Their captors should desist from making any attempts to further harass them. We extend our gratitude to all those who supported calls to surface Eco and Jak. Your swift and resolute actions have been invaluable confronting this challenging time. To Eco and Jak and their families, we stand steadfast in solidarity throughout this difficult period,&#8221; the fact-finding team added. </p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-why-this-matters"">Why this matters </h5>



<p>Activists in the Philippines are often victims of several attacks, such as red-tagging and abduction. </p>



<p>Before Dangla and Tiong, two young environmental activists were also abducted last year. Jonila Castro and Jhed Tamano, who were doing groundwork for a study on a reclamation project in Bataan province, were reported&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/women-environmental-activists-abducted-bataan-september-2023/"">abducted</a>&nbsp;by progressive groups&nbsp;in September 2023, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/chr-probes-abduction-women-environmental-activists/"">prompting</a> a Commission on Human Rights probe. </p>



<p>Later, security officials announced that Castro and Tamano were already “safe and sound” after they allegedly&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/missing-activists-safe-sound-national-security-council-briefing-september-2023/"">“voluntarily surrendered”</a>&nbsp;to the military. But when the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) presented the two as alleged surrenderees, Castro and Tamano&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/environmental-activists-statement-abduction-ntf-elcac-press-conference/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">went off-script</a>&nbsp;and belied claims they had surrendered. </p>



<p>Because of the two’s revelations that blindsided the NTF-ELCAC, they were slapped with a perjury complaint by Lieutenant Colonel Ronnel dela Cruz of the Philippine Army.</p>



<p>Although the Department of Justice dismissed the perjury complaint against the two, prosecutors <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/doj-indicts-slander-jonila-castro-jhed-tamano/"">pushed a slander or grave oral defamation case</a> against them for “embarrassing and putting [the Armed Forces of the Philippines] in bad light.” Castro and Tamano were ordered arrested in February, but <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/jonila-castro-jhed-tamano-warrant-arrest-after-supreme-court-victory/"">posted bail</a>. Their case is still being tried.  </p>



<p>Castro and Tamano were the 14th documented case of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/chr-investigation-afp-intelligence-fake-surrender-case/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">“fake surrenders,”</a>&nbsp;where people are abducted and coerced into executing an affidavit of surrender.</p>



<p>Environmental activists in the Philippines also get killed for their work. For the 10th straight year, the Philippines was named the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippines-asia-deadliest-country-land-environmental-defenders-2023/"">most dangerous country in Asia for land and environmental defenders</a>, according to nongovernmental organization Global Witness. Of the 16 killings of environmental defenders in Asia, at least 11 were recorded in the Philippines. </p>

<p>The Foundation for Media Alternatives (FMA) hosted the <a href=""https://fma.rappler.com/604/civil-society-to-celebrate-30-years-of-philippine-internet-in-digital-rights-conference-2024/"">Digital Rights Conference</a>, Wednesday, March 20, at the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), celebrating thirty years since the Philippines first connected to the internet on March 29, 1994.</p>



<p>With the theme, &#8220;Honoring the Past, Safeguarding the Future,&#8221; the event gathered experts from various tech and advocacy spheres to reflect on the pioneering days of the internet and discuss pressing issues facing digital rights today.</p>



<p>“The miracle of the internet has changed the world and enriched our lives,” opened Raphael Guerrero, Dean of the Ateneo’s School of Science and Engineering.</p>



<p>Rodolfo Villarica, known as one of the fathers of Philippine internet, recalled the challenges of establishing the country’s gateway to the web – particularly, the large cost associated with the project and uncertainties regarding equipment procurement.</p>



<p>Despite these obstacles, the project, called PHNET, was a resounding success. Three decades later, the internet has become an integral part of life, easing the speed and inclusivity of information while also engendering new threats that necessitate the recognition of digital rights. Such has been the embrace of Filipinos of the technology, that they&#8217;ve become the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/technology/internet-culture/worlds-vlogging-capital-filipinos-outrank-rest-vlogs-influencers-digital-report-2024/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20half,32%25%20watch%20vlogs%20per%20week."">world&#8217;s biggest consumers of vlogs</a>, and a top social media user. </p>

<p>In line with the celebration of Women’s Month, Liza Garcia of FMA recognized the historical contribution of women in technological advancement – Ada Lovelace, the first programmer; Hedy Lamarr, inventor of frequency-hopping technology now used for WiFi and Bluetooth; and Merlita Opena, who pioneered works in technology transfer and databases.</p>



<p>For the opening remarks, Senator Risa Hontiveros spoke about the policies that protect against online harassment and gender-based discrimination, in particular, the Safe Spaces Act and the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children Act.</p>



<p>“The same danger that exists in the real world also exists online, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/effect-false-information-online-girls-philippines-truth-gap-report-2021/"">especially for vulnerable groups like women</a>,” explained Grace Salonga, executive director of the Movement Against Disinformation.</p>



<p>“Technology can facilitate polarization and division in a society, unlike before, when you knew that certain wrongdoing could be confined within a territory. Now it’s a mission, and it can happen within hours.”<br><br>Since its adoption in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has served to recognize and safeguard the fundamental rights of human beings regardless of sex, race, religion, or other status. According to Jamael Jacob, Data Protection Officer of the ADMU, the principles of the UDHR must persist despite the changing tides of technology.</p>



<p>He divided digital rights into two aspects: rights on the internet, and rights to the internet.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-rights-on-the-internet""><strong>Rights on the internet</strong></h5>



<p>Rights on the internet are the same inalienable rights afforded to everyone offline. With the instantaneous accessibility of information comes the right to freely receive and share it through any media, and be able to express and hold opinions without interference.&nbsp;</p>

This has been corrected.       The Foundation for Media Alternatives (FMA) hosted the  Digital Rights Conference , Wednesday, March 20, at the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), celebrating thirty years since the Philippines first connected to the internet on March 29, 1994.      With the theme, ""Honoring the Past, Safeguarding the Future,"" the event gathered experts from various tech and advocacy spheres to reflect on the pioneering days of the internet and discuss pressing issues facing digital rights today.      ""The miracle of the internet has changed the world and enriched our lives,"" opened Raphael Guerrero, Dean of the Ateneo's School of Science and Engineering.      Rodolfo Villarica, known as one of the fathers of Philippine internet, recalled the challenges of establishing the country's gateway to the web - particularly, the large cost associated with the project and uncertainties regarding equipment procurement.      Despite these obstacles, the project, called PHNET, was a resounding success. Three decades later, the internet has become an integral part of life, easing the speed and inclusivity of information while also engendering new threats that necessitate the recognition of digital rights. Such has been the embrace of Filipinos of the technology, that they've become the  world's biggest consumers of vlogs , and a top social media user.        Women's month in the digital ag e      In line with the celebration of Women's Month, Liza Garcia of FMA recognized the historical contribution of women in technological advancement - Ada Lovelace, the first programmer; Hedy Lamarr, inventor of frequency-hopping technology now used for WiFi and Bluetooth; and Merlita Opena, who pioneered works in technology transfer and databases.      For the opening remarks, Senator Risa Hontiveros spoke about the policies that protect against online harassment and gender-based discrimination, in particular, the Safe Spaces Act and the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children Act.      ""The same danger that exists in the real world also exists online,  especially for vulnerable groups like women ,"" explained Grace Salonga, executive director of the Movement Against Disinformation.      ""Technology can facilitate polarization and division in a society, unlike before, when you knew that certain wrongdoing could be confined within a territory. Now it's a mission, and it can happen within hours.""  Since its adoption in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has served to recognize and safeguard the fundamental rights of human beings regardless of sex, race, religion, or other status. According to Jamael Jacob, Data Protection Officer of the ADMU, the principles of the UDHR must persist despite the changing tides of technology.      He divided digital rights into two aspects: rights on the internet, and rights to the internet.       Rights on the internet       Rights on the internet are the same inalienable rights afforded to everyone offline. With the instantaneous accessibility of information comes the right to freely receive and share it through any media, and be able to express and hold opinions without interference.       For Jacob, this right is threatened by the  spread of disinformation  facilitated by both government and private actors. Recent advances such as generative artificial intelligence have also been misused to  produce fake content  and  exacerbate surveillance through its collection of training data .      Additionally, he noted the online attacks on the  freedom of the press  - with  websites being taken down  and journalists facing harassment and charges of  cyber libel .       He listed controversial legislations that may threaten people's digital rights; including the  Anti-Terrorism Act  and the  Philippine Identification System Act , which can track a record history of one's PhilSys transactions using the ID.

<p class=""has-drop-cap"">NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – It was pitch-black outside Felizardo dela Cruz&#8217;s nipa hut, making it impossible to see what was happening as the wind howled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already 69 at the time, Dela Cruz could not see anything beyond the faint silhouette of the bamboo walls of his hut that kept him safe from the vicious storm.</p>



<p>The howling wind and the raging currents of the river a stone&#8217;s throw from his home were deafening. Typhoon Odette (Rai) was unleashing all its fury.</p>



<p>Dela Cruz was about to leave his hut to seek shelter at the nearest evacuation center – a two-hour walk from where he was – when he saw floodwaters rising. He thought his home would soon be swallowed by the water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that moment, Dela Cruz faced the same tough questions that hundreds of thousands of Filipino families have had to ask themselves when a disaster is imminent: Will we survive at home? Will we survive the journey to the shelter? If we make it to the shelter, will it offer us more protection than staying at home?</p>



<p>Accepting his fate, Dela Cruz decided to stay put.</p>

Felizardo dela Cruz survived Odette’s raging floods by staying in his bamboo hut, a structure almost identical to his current home where he sits as he tells his almost biblical story.

<p>A few minutes later, he began to feel dizzy as he felt the bamboo floor rocking back and forth. His furniture started moving, some of them getting knocked over. Already half-submerged in water, his home was getting washed away by a flash flood – with him inside.</p>



<p>Shivering in the cold, Dela Cruz mustered all his strength to cry for help but immediately realized he was all alone with no one to rescue him. He kept still and just tried to survive the night.</p>



<p>Then he noticed that his hut stopped moving. He stepped out, only to discover that the raging waters had washed his home all the way to Tauangan, a sitio about nine kilometers away.</p>



<p>When the adrenaline rush subsided, Dela Cruz felt pain in his right foot and saw a four- to five-inch nail piercing his shin.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-11.26.13%E2%80%AFAM.png?fit=1024%2C1024"" alt=""Adult, Male, Man"" class=""wp-image-2629490""/><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">INJURY. Dela Cruz miraculously suffered only two minor injuries while he was inside his bamboo hut as it was washed away by Odette&#8217;s flood: one caused by a four- to five-inch nail that pierced his shin and another caused by a piece of a roof that wounded his foot. Photos by Reymund Titong/Rappler</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I was lucky because I survived. A lot of people died because of Odette. If I had left my house, I’d probably have died back then,&#8221; Dela Cruz said in Hiligaynon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dela Cruz lives in Kalatong, a low-lying area where the tributary rivers of Cabadiangan and Kalatong merge with the Sipalay River, about 900 kilometers south of Manila. Kalatong is located in Cabadiangan, the village with the highest death toll in Sipalay City, Negros Occidental, during Odette.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Months of analysis by Rappler unpacked who the most exposed to natural hazards in Negros Occidental are. This is among the provinces in the Philippines with the highest exposure to multiple hazards and risks. </p>



<p>The investigation also looked at whose houses are most at risk of being washed away, which evacuation centers across the province are most likely to keep people safe, and which ones might put people in greater danger. In the second part of this investigation, Rappler explored what the local government is doing about these.</p>

<p>Odette made landfall <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-super-typhoon-rai-odette-humanitarian-needs-and-priorities-revision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">nine times</a> from December 16 to 17, 2021, as it made its way through southern and central Philippines. It left massive destruction in different parts of all island groups in the Philippines, destroying homes, damaging roads and bridges, and toppling communication and power lines.</p>



<p>According to then-United Nations representative to the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez, Odette was the <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/statement-mr-gustavo-gonzalez-un-resident-coordinator-and-humanitarian-0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">second deadliest disaster</a> to hit the globe in 2021, next to the magnitude 7.2 <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/technical-report-haiti-earthquake-interconnected-disaster-risks-20212022"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">earthquake</a> in Haiti. </p>



<p>Gonzalez said the damage caused by the typhoon was &#8220;comparable&#8221; to that caused by <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/ten-years-super-typhoon-yolanda-survivors-grapple-memory-delayed-recovery/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Super Typhoon Yolanda</a> (Haiyan), one of the most powerful typhoons in history. Though the magnitudes of the storms were impossible to measure and compare exactly, the number of people who were vulnerable to such disasters was not.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-people-in-peril"">People in peril&nbsp;</h5>



<p>Dela Cruz&#8217;s almost biblical story of survival was just one among the hundreds of thousands of stories of Negrosanons who were affected by flooding caused by Odette. According to <a href=""https://www.foi.gov.ph/requests/aglzfmVmb2ktcGhyHQsSB0NvbnRlbnQiEE9DRC02NTA5MjcyMjMwMjMM"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">data</a> from the Office of Civil Defense, a total of 1.5 million Negrosanons were affected by the typhoon, and government maps show that many of them were at risk.</p>



<p>Analysis of the data from state hazard assessment portal HazardHunterPH showed that more than 380,000 people in Negros Occidental are at high risk of flooding. Overall, more than half of all residents in the province live in areas that have varying degrees of flood risk.</p>



<p>According to the environment department’s Mines and Geosciences Bureau, one of the government offices involved in the creation of the hazard assessment portal, towns with a high risk of floods may be submerged in one to two meters of water for over three days. For most Filipinos, the depth is already waist to chest-deep. Those with a very high susceptibility to floods may experience more than two meters of flooding.</p>

<p>According to our analysis, one out of every seven people in Sipalay City, where Dela Cruz lives, resides in areas at high risk of flooding. A quarter of them are children younger than 10 years old.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Houses at risk</h5>



<p>Despite the availability of official data identifying risks of flooding, this has not translated to the construction of flood-resistant houses. More than half of the province’s cities and municipalities are also vulnerable to destruction by typhoons, according to a <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590061721000715"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2021 study</a> done by researchers at The University of Sydney School of Civil Engineering.</p>



<p>The Housing Vulnerability Index (HVI), as the researchers called it, was calculated by measuring and aggregating several components at the municipal level – including how crowded a house was, the quality of materials used, structural integrity, and the availability of water sources, among others – to determine how vulnerable homes are to disasters brought by typhoons.</p>



<p>Negros Occidental also ranked 11th out of 84 provinces in terms of exposure to multiple hazard risks, according to the 2021 <a href=""https://www.pdc.org/wp-content/uploads/NDPBA-PHL-Province-Profile-New-Merged-compressed.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Philippine Province Risk Profiles</a> of Pacific Disaster Center (PDC).</p>



<p>On top of these, if the towns<strong> </strong>in Negros Occidental are ranked according to poverty incidence and the number of health facilities and schools in high-risk flood zones, Sipalay City emerges as having the most vulnerable houses, the highest poverty rate, and the most facilities at risk of flooding. Based on the latest municipal-level estimates, almost one in four Sipalay residents earned below P20,464 ($388) a month in 2018, which is insufficient to meet basic food requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unaware of just how vulnerable they are, many Sipalay City residents ignored voluntary evacuation orders ahead of Odette. Local officials said that Odette was the most powerful typhoon they experienced in recent memory.</p>



<p>Narcisso Biasong, a charcoal maker from Barangay Mambaroto, said he had heard the local government’s warning about Odette through the <em>korida</em>, a public announcement system that makes the rounds in the city in times of disasters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told his family about the warning but admitted that he and his family dismissed it. “We were complacent because many storms have passed but we were spared from them and nothing happened,” he told Rappler.</p>

Biasong told Rappler that he regrets deciding too late to go to the evacuation center, which cost the lives of his wife and grandchild. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead of going to an evacuation center, Biasong’s family stayed home that day. Only when the flood was already hip-high did his family decide to take refuge in their neighbor’s house located on higher ground; it was too late to go to the evacuation center, which was a 30-minute walk across farm fields.</p>



<p>By the time they decided to flee, floodwaters were already raging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My wife and grandchild were those washed away by the flood. I can still hear my wife shouting for help when she was carried away by the flood. I was the only one who remained in my house, while the rest made it to our neighbor on higher ground,” Biasong told Rappler. His wife and grandchild died.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Critical facilities in danger&nbsp;</h5>



<p>In the Philippines, it&#8217;s rare to find evacuation centers used exclusively for disasters. Data from the Office of Civil Defense in 2019 showed that only about 3 in 100 of the total evacuation centers in the Philippines are primarily used as refuge during disasters.</p>



<p>In the whole of Negros Occidental, there are only five evacuation centers,&nbsp;three of which are located in high-risk areas. In Sipalay, there are none; instead, the city’s health centers, government buildings, and schools double as evacuation centers during these perilous times.</p>



<p>Data analysis suggests that in the case of Biasong, he had no good evacuation options because both his house and nearby facilities were extremely vulnerable. Schools in Sipalay City, supposed to be safe havens in the city during disasters, were not spared by the floods brought by Odette.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Analysis of HazardHunterPH data shows that Sipalay has the most number of schools with a very high risk of flooding in Negros Occidental. About one in four schools is in high-risk and very high-risk flood zones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>May Intac Matia-ong, a health unit staff in Barangay 5, told Rappler that during Odette, there were areas in her barangay “with neck-deep floods,” which she attributed to heavy rains and proximity to the shore. She said two families who evacuated with them had to stay on the second floor as the ground floor “was already flooded.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The health unit staff told Rappler that most people in their barangay evacuated to Sipalay City National High School and Barangay V (Sipalay) Elementary School.<strong> </strong>The two schools were in the same compound.</p>



<p>The schools Matia-ong mentioned were not the only ones at risk of flooding. Several other schools, health facilities, and evacuation centers across the province were built in flood zones.</p>

<p>Almost half of all health facilities in Sipalay City are at very high risk of flooding. Of the 19 facilities, eight are Barangay Health Units (BHU), while one is a Rural Health Unit (RHU). BHUs and RHUs are part of the primary level of the Philippines’ healthcare system.</p>



<p>Sipalay is followed by Cadiz, a city in northern Negros Occidental. A quarter of its schools and half of its evacuation centers are in high-risk flood zones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another city worth taking note of is Himamaylan City in central Negros Occidental. It has only two facilities used exclusively as evacuation centers, with one facility located in a high-risk flood zone.</p>



<p>Recounting her experience during Odette, Matia-ong told Rappler: “Despite Sipalay City National High School being on higher ground, the flood still reached the rooms where we stayed during Typhoon Odette. We know that the flood will reach the area where we are evacuated because our place is really prone to flooding. Barangay V is located in a low-lying area.”</p>



<p>“Typhoons hit us only a few times, but when it happens, there&#8217;s a high chance that we will get flooded,” she added.</p>



<p>After Odette, Sipalay officials have asked residents living near Kalatong River like Dela Cruz to move to higher ground.</p>



<p>The city government also said it plans to relocate some of the schools out of flood zones. Experts warn that it would not be an easy task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for Sipalay City National High School, officials said it would also be moved to a different location due to land ownership issues – and not because of the flood risk.</p>

","<p>Part 1: Rappler&#8217;s data analysis of HazardHunterPH data shows that Sipalay has the most number of schools that double as evacuation centers during disasters, with a very high risk of flooding in Negros Occidental</p>
",https://www.rappler.com/environment/critical-facilities-risk-flooding-sipalay-city-negros-occidental/,2024-03-28T08:30:00,2024-04-01T11:12:08,"[16490, 793, 709, 708, 701]",Flood-prone lifelines: Critical facilities at risk of flooding in Negros Occidental town,"  NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines - It was pitch-black outside Felizardo dela Cruz's nipa hut, making it impossible to see what was happening as the wind howled.       Already 69 at the time, Dela Cruz could not see anything beyond the faint silhouette of the bamboo walls of his hut that kept him safe from the vicious storm.      The howling wind and the raging currents of the river a stone's throw from his home were deafening. Typhoon Odette (Rai) was unleashing all its fury.      Dela Cruz was about to leave his hut to seek shelter at the nearest evacuation center - a two-hour walk from where he was - when he saw floodwaters rising. He thought his home would soon be swallowed by the water.       At that moment, Dela Cruz faced the same tough questions that hundreds of thousands of Filipino families have had to ask themselves when a disaster is imminent: Will we survive at home? Will we survive the journey to the shelter? If we make it to the shelter, will it offer us more protection than staying at home?      Accepting his fate, Dela Cruz decided to stay put.        BAMBOO HUT. Felizardo dela Cruz survived Odette's raging floods by staying in his bamboo hut, a structure almost identical to his current home where he sits as he tells his almost biblical story. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler       A few minutes later, he began to feel dizzy as he felt the bamboo floor rocking back and forth. His furniture started moving, some of them getting knocked over. Already half-submerged in water, his home was getting washed away by a flash flood - with him inside.      Shivering in the cold, Dela Cruz mustered all his strength to cry for help but immediately realized he was all alone with no one to rescue him. He kept still and just tried to survive the night.      Then he noticed that his hut stopped moving. He stepped out, only to discover that the raging waters had washed his home all the way to Tauangan, a sitio about nine kilometers away.      When the adrenaline rush subsided, Dela Cruz felt pain in his right foot and saw a four- to five-inch nail piercing his shin.        INJURY. Dela Cruz miraculously suffered only two minor injuries while he was inside his bamboo hut as it was washed away by Odette's flood: one caused by a four- to five-inch nail that pierced his shin and another caused by a piece of a roof that wounded his foot. Photos by Reymund Titong/Rappler       ""I was lucky because I survived. A lot of people died because of Odette. If I had left my house, I'd probably have died back then,"" Dela Cruz said in Hiligaynon.       Dela Cruz lives in Kalatong, a low-lying area where the tributary rivers of Cabadiangan and Kalatong merge with the Sipalay River, about 900 kilometers south of Manila. Kalatong is located in Cabadiangan, the village with the highest death toll in Sipalay City, Negros Occidental, during Odette.       Months of analysis by Rappler unpacked who the most exposed to natural hazards in Negros Occidental are. This is among the provinces in the Philippines with the highest exposure to multiple hazards and risks.       The investigation also looked at whose houses are most at risk of being washed away, which evacuation centers across the province are most likely to keep people safe, and which ones might put people in greater danger. In the second part of this investigation, Rappler explored what the local government is doing about these.        WHERE RIVERS MEET. Kalatong was submerged in deep floods in the evening when Odette hit Sipalay - where the Kalatong, Cabadiangan, and Sipalay rivers converge. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler       Odette made landfall  nine times  from December 16 to 17, 2021, as it made its way through southern and central Philippines. It left massive destruction in different parts of all island groups in the Philippines, destroying homes, damaging roads and bridges, and toppling communication and power lines.      According to then-United Nations representative to the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez, Odette was the  second deadliest disaster  to hit the globe in 2021, next to the magnitude 7.2  earthquake  in Haiti.       Gonzalez said the damage caused by the typhoon was ""comparable"" to that caused by  Super Typhoon Yolanda  (Haiyan), one of the most powerful typhoons in history. Though the magnitudes of the storms were impossible to measure and compare exactly, the number of people who were vulnerable to such disasters was not.       People in peril       Dela Cruz's almost biblical story of survival was just one among the hundreds of thousands of stories of Negrosanons who were affected by flooding caused by Odette. According to  data  from the Office of Civil Defense, a total of 1.5 million Negrosanons were affected by the typhoon, and government maps show that many of them were at risk.      Analysis of the data from state hazard assessment portal HazardHunterPH showed that more than 380,000 people in Negros Occidental are at high risk of flooding. Overall, more than half of all residents in the province live in areas that have varying degrees of flood risk.      According to the environment department's Mines and Geosciences Bureau, one of the government offices involved in the creation of the hazard assessment portal, towns with a high risk of floods may be submerged in one to two meters of water for over three days. For most Filipinos, the depth is already waist to chest-deep. Those with a very high susceptibility to floods may experience more than two meters of flooding.                  According to our analysis, one out of every seven people in Sipalay City, where Dela Cruz lives, resides in areas at high risk of flooding. A quarter of them are children younger than 10 years old.       Houses at risk      Despite the availability of official data identifying risks of flooding, this has not translated to the construction of flood-resistant houses. More than half of the province's cities and municipalities are also vulnerable to destruction by typhoons, according to a  2021 study  done by researchers at The University of Sydney School of Civil Engineering.      The Housing Vulnerability Index (HVI), as the researchers called it, was calculated by measuring and aggregating several components at the municipal level - including how crowded a house was, the quality of materials used, structural integrity, and the availability of water sources, among others - to determine how vulnerable homes are to disasters brought by typhoons.      Negros Occidental also ranked 11th out of 84 provinces in terms of exposure to multiple hazard risks, according to the 2021  Philippine Province Risk Profiles  of Pacific Disaster Center (PDC).      On top of these, if the towns   in Negros Occidental are ranked according to poverty incidence and the number of health facilities and schools in high-risk flood zones, Sipalay City emerges as having the most vulnerable houses, the highest poverty rate, and the most facilities at risk of flooding. Based on the latest municipal-level estimates, almost one in four Sipalay residents earned below P20,464 ($388) a month in 2018, which is insufficient to meet basic food requirements.       Unaware of just how vulnerable they are, many Sipalay City residents ignored voluntary evacuation orders ahead of Odette. Local officials said that Odette was the most powerful typhoon they experienced in recent memory.      Narcisso Biasong, a charcoal maker from Barangay Mambaroto, said he had heard the local government's warning about Odette through the  korida , a public announcement system that makes the rounds in the city in times of disasters.       He told his family about the warning but admitted that he and his family dismissed it. ""We were complacent because many storms have passed but we were spared from them and nothing happened,"" he told Rappler.        TOO LATE. Biasong told Rappler that he regrets deciding too late to go to the evacuation center, which cost the lives of his wife and grandchild. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler       Instead of going to an evacuation center, Biasong's family stayed home that day. Only when the flood was already hip-high did his family decide to take refuge in their neighbor's house located on higher ground; it was too late to go to the evacuation center, which was a 30-minute walk across farm fields.      By the time they decided to flee, floodwaters were already raging.       ""My wife and grandchild were those washed away by the flood. I can still hear my wife shouting for help when she was carried away by the flood. I was the only one who remained in my house, while the rest made it to our neighbor on higher ground,"" Biasong told Rappler. His wife and grandchild died.      Critical facilities in danger       In the Philippines, it's rare to find evacuation centers used exclusively for disasters. Data from the Office of Civil Defense in 2019 showed that only about 3 in 100 of the total evacuation centers in the Philippines are primarily used as refuge during disasters.      In the whole of Negros Occidental, there are only five evacuation centers, three of which are located in high-risk areas. In Sipalay, there are none; instead, the city's health centers, government buildings, and schools double as evacuation centers during these perilous times.      Data analysis suggests that in the case of Biasong, he had no good evacuation options because both his house and nearby facilities were extremely vulnerable. Schools in Sipalay City, supposed to be safe havens in the city during disasters, were not spared by the floods brought by Odette.       Analysis of HazardHunterPH data shows that Sipalay has the most number of schools with a very high risk of flooding in Negros Occidental. About one in four schools is in high-risk and very high-risk flood zones.       May Intac Matia-ong, a health unit staff in Barangay 5, told Rappler that during Odette, there were areas in her barangay ""with neck-deep floods,"" which she attributed to heavy rains and proximity to the shore. She said two families who evacuated with them had to stay on the second floor as the ground floor ""was already flooded.""         NOT SPARED. Matia-ong says that the flood during Odette even reached the rooms at the evacuation center where they stayed. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler       The health unit staff told Rappler that most people in their barangay evacuated to Sipalay City National High School and Barangay V (Sipalay) Elementary School.   The two schools were in the same compound.      The schools Matia-ong mentioned were not the only ones at risk of flooding. Several other schools, health facilities, and evacuation centers across the province were built in flood zones.                  Almost half of all health facilities in Sipalay City are at very high risk of flooding. Of the 19 facilities, eight are Barangay Health Units (BHU), while one is a Rural Health Unit (RHU). BHUs and RHUs are part of the primary level of the Philippines' healthcare system.      Sipalay is followed by Cadiz, a city in northern Negros Occidental. A quarter of its schools and half of its evacuation centers are in high-risk flood zones.       Another city worth taking note of is Himamaylan City in central Negros Occidental.

2629818,journalists-statements-reactions-slam-china-manipulation-claims,Journalists in Manila slam China&#8217;s manipulation claims: ‘Barefaced lie&#8217;,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – Journalist groups in the Philippines on Wednesday, March 27, criticized China’s foreign ministry and its embassy in Manila over claims that journalists who embed in the Philippines’ rotation and resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal “manipulate” their work to “project the Philippines as a victim.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The association strongly rejects and condemns the false, baseless claims by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying and the Chinese Embassy in Manila that journalists ‘manipulate the videos they recorded’ in South China Sea to ‘project the Philippines as a victim,” said the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (FOCAP) in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP), meanwhile, said in a separate statement that it “takes offense at the insinuation” first made by the China Foreign Ministry’s mouthpiece. </p>



<p>In a statement released late March 27, the Defense Press Corps of the Philippines (DPC) said it &#8220;takes exception to the baseless allegations of the Chinese Foreign Ministry which cast aspersions on the integrity of Filipino journalists covering the resupply missions of the Philippine Government within its own Exclusive Economic Zone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The journalists who join these missions, risk their lives in the face of unwanted aggression to bring the unvarnished truth to light. It is unfortunate some would still call the work of these independent Filipino journalists as manipulated sensationalism. We reject and condemn this false accusation,&#8221; the independent group, composed of journalists assigned and accredited to cover the defense beat, said. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-troublemakers"">&#8216;Troublemakers&#8217;</h5>



<p>Hua, in a series of graphics, painted the Philippines and journalists who join resupply missions as “troublemakers.”</p>



<p>“Each time the Philippines delivered supplies to the grounded warship, they had many journalists on board, and had them manipulate the videos they recorded to make sensational news and project the Philippines as a victim,” said China’s foreign ministry spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chinese embassy in Manila posted the same series of graphics on its social media accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“FOCAP takes deep offense at the insinuation that the press is a ‘troublemaker’ and in cahoots with the government to forward a political agenda,” said the association, whose membership is voluntary and includes both Filipino and foreign nationals assigned to report on the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It added: “The claim that the Philippines ‘had [journalists] manipulate’ their footage is a barefaced lie.”</p>



<p>“A free and independent press reports not what they are told, but what they observe, framed by historical and political context. The footage seen in the press is vetted by multiple sources and newsrooms. The work of journalists, including members of FOCAP and especially when carried by multiple media outlets, speaks for itself,” said FOCAP. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The group added: “The statements by the Foreign Ministry spokesman &amp; Embassy are an insult to the integrity of journalists and an alarming attempt to muzzle an independent press. FOCAP will not be intimidated by threats and groundless attempts to smear its members’ reputation. We will continue to courageously cover developments and the impact of events in South China Sea and across the region.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NUJP, a group whose membership is also voluntary, reiterated that media “ is not a party to the dispute and should not be demonized by parties for airing contending views on the issue and unflattering reports on incidents in the West Philippine Sea.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Contrary to the ministry&#8217;s claims on its social media accounts, journalists on these missions provide on-site reports of incidents in the West Philippine Sea, often at their personal risk. Except for operational and national security considerations, state forces have no say in the production and editorial decisions on these reports,” NUJP said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It added: “In reporting on the West Philippine Sea, the media cannot avoid referring to incidents they witnessed, the Philippine position on the WPS, the 2016 Hague ruling, and the impact China&#8217;s actions in our waters affect our fisherfolk and coastal communities.”</p>

2629553,korean-wave-success-factors-united-nations-conference-trade-development-study,"Free expression, copyright protection cited as factors for success of Korean Wave","
<p>MANILA, Philippines – A recent study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has cited the importance of freedom of expression and copyright protection as factors behind the Korean Wave, also known as<em> </em>Hallyu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its report “<a href=""https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditctsce2023d3_en.pdf"">K-Content goes global: How government support and copyright policy fuelled the Republic of Korea’s Creative Economy,</a>” published on March 21, UNCTAD said that a “noteworthy feature” of Korea’s recent cultural policy “is the reduction in censorship, quotas, and restrictions on imports.” </p>



<p>Quoting Hye-Kyung Lee, a senior lecturer at the Department of Culture, Media and Creative Industries in King’s College London, United Kingdom, UNCTAD said “freedom of expression and democracy is a requirement for the dynamic creativity that led to the Korean Wave.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It cited the following policy developments:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>1988 to 1993: Restrictions on key sectors of the creative industries – publishers, theater, film – were removed or reduced.</li>



<li>1993 to 1998: The Korean government continued the policy of ending censorship, “which allowed creative producers to explore new forms and diversify their cultural outputs.”&nbsp;</li>



<li>1993-2003: The government passed several laws that “clearly indicated a shift in the government’s stance on cultural policy from regulation and control to promotion.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>“Through this process, cultural freedom, which had initially emerged as a political issue, became a pre-requisite of consumer society and a baseline of cultural promotion policy,” UNCTAD said, quoting Lee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report said K-Content comprises 11 areas:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>publishing </li>



<li>comics </li>



<li>music </li>



<li>games </li>



<li>film </li>



<li>animation (motion picture) </li>



<li>broadcasting</li>



<li>advertisement </li>



<li>characters </li>



<li>knowledge information </li>



<li>content solutions.</li>
</ul>



<p>A survey by Korea’s Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism (MCST) showed the content-based industry of South Korea generating $108 billion in sales, growing at 4.9% a year from 2016 to 2020.</p>



<p>Among the examples of K-Content cited in the report are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>2020 Oscars Best Picture <em>Parasite</em></li>

<p>UNCTAD said the main success factors in driving the popularity of Korean wave are creativity and uniqueness of K-Content which appeal worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In music or <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/korean-popular-music/"">K-pop</a>, it noted the role of <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/hybe-seeks-take-over-k-pop-rival-agency-sm-entertainment/"">Korea’s entertainment agencies</a> in “casting and training potential idol groups to producing music and promotion for the global markets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For example, the agencies focus on discovering ‘hidden gems’ with great potential and investing in their long-term development and training to enable them to debut as K-pop idols. K-pop idols attract audiences worldwide with appealing melodies and synchronized group dance,” the report said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/topic/korean-series/"">K-drama</a>, the “themes are often universal in nature with simple storylines, while reflecting a wide range of complex human emotions, and employing new and innovative plotlines that are highly captivating to all.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report said the rapid growth of mobile technologies and social media since the mid-2000s was a “decisive factor for the global expansion of K-content.” These “reduce the costs and time needed for overseas expansion,” and enable “fans to help spread content easily,” UNCTAD said, citing a study by four Koreans on the K-pop industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, &#8220;Success Factors and Sustainability of the K-Pop Industry: A Structural Equation Model and Fuzzy Set Analysis,&#8221; was funded by the Korean government with a grant from the<strong> </strong>National Research Foundation of Korea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“As K-pop, K-drama and films continue attracting people around the world, the Korean wave is expanding into other cultural areas such as food, tourism, and language. In particular, K-pop stars contribute to enhancing demand for goods produced in the Republic of Korea and stimulated interest in K-culture, including traditional food, tourism, and local language,” the report said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A survey by the Korea Foundation for International Exchange on the impact of Hallyu said that overseas consumers now intend to purchase food, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/profiles-and-advocacies/181320-korean-skincare-beauty-products/"">K-beauty products</a>, and trips to Korea due to the impact of Hallyu.&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-lessons-and-factors"">Lessons and factors</h5>



<p>UNCTAD said developing economies can pick up lessons from the Korean Wave and apply them to their own situations.</p>



<p>“The Republic of Korea&#8217;s strategic embrace of the creative economy shows how creativity and innovation can drive economic transformation and growth,” said Marisa Henderson, head of UNCTAD’s creative economy section, in a press statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It offers an inspiring model for countries aiming to turn their cultural assets and creative industries into engines of growth and development.”</p>



<p>Henderson said Korea’s “ascent to the global cultural spotlight didn&#8217;t happen by chance,” but “was engineered by a strategic combination of government policy and private sector innovation.”</p>



<p>UNCTAD said a key to Korea’s success was its “comprehensive institutional framework” led by its <a href=""https://www.mcst.go.kr/english/"">Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This government agency acted as the umbrella organization which coordinated the work of other bodies involved in Korea’s creative industries including the <a href=""https://www.kocca.kr/en/main.do"">Korea Creative Content Agency</a>, Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange, and the Korea Film Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Supported by trillions of won in government funding, they helped sculpt the country’s ascent as a cultural titan,” UNCTAD said.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote"">
<p>“The Republic of Korea&#8217;s ascent to the global cultural spotlight didn&#8217;t happen by chance. It was engineered by a strategic combination of government policy and private sector innovation.” </p>
<cite>&#8211; Marisa Henderson, head of UNCTAD’s creative economy section</cite></blockquote>



<p>“Government financial incentives, including loans and tax breaks, alongside measures such as intellectual property protection, fostered an environment ripe for innovation and technological advancement,” it added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UNCTAD also stressed the importance of investing in education. In Korea’s case, it said that investments in the Korean Academy of Film Arts, as well as the Korea National University of Arts, “played a pivotal role in nurturing a new wave of creators who have adeptly used new digital platforms like YouTube and Netflix to reach audiences beyond national and Asian consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo Hyun-Rae, president of the Korea Creative Content Agency, said that “through strategic investments and supportive policies, the government and the private sector have cultivated a creative ecosystem where innovation thrives and cultural products reach global audiences.”&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-unprecedented"">&#8216;Unprecedented&#8217;</h5>



<p>The report described the Korean Wave as “an unprecedented phenomenon,” since it now “offers a counterpoint to the dominant western mediascape.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Republic of Korea was on the periphery of the global cultural content market, dominated by North America and Europe. Yet, the worldwide spread of ‘Hallyu’ the extent of which was perhaps surprising to the people of the Republic of Korea themselves, provides an example of how to capitalise on the creative industries for other developing countries as well,” UNCTAD said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the “striking features” of the Korean Wave is that the appeal has been worldwide “despite significant language and cultural differences between K-culture and many western consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It said the case of Korea “represent a sea change in our thinking about what it is that international audiences are looking for and can appreciate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>UNCTAD added that it’s the digital age that has made this possible. &nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-different-from-west"">Different from West</h5>



<p>Unlike the Western approach which the report described as free market (minimal government intervention) and mainly led by the private sector, UNCTAD said Korea’s example was state-led and heavily funded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At its core, the Republic of Korea&#8217;s remarkable ascent in the content-based industry can be traced back to a comprehensive ecosystem, fostered by a coordinated nationwide policy approach, and reinforced by effective copyright enforcement,” UNCTAD said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Republic of Korea’s case is an example of the all-of-the-government approach for policy making and implementation linked to the development of creative sectors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report cited Korea’s Cultural Content Production Fund which poured $2 billion or P112.4 billion to the country&#8217;s content-based industry from 2006 to 2021 or P7.4 billion yearly.</p>



<p>In contrast, UNCTAD said many developing countries have “tended to reduce funding” to its creative industries during hard times such as when the COVID-19 pandemic struck. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-mitigating-risks"">Mitigating risks</h5>



<p>The report also noted that while government funding was initially focused on large companies, it has since also included small and medium enterprises and venture startups which, it said, “are known to be an important source of creativity and innovation in the sector.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>UNCTAD said investments in creative industries are high-risk since it’s very hard to know what content will click with the audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To mitigate the risk, UNCTAD said Korea established the Content Assessment Center which assesses the value of creative content. The center issues a “content assessment certificate,” which can be used as a basis in accessing loans and investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Government also supplies funding that supports some of the riskiest parts of the creative industries value chain such as R&amp;D [Research and Development], start-ups, and ventures at the start of their production cycle, and by providing completion guarantee bonds. This reduces the risk to the private sector, and boosts investment in the content-based industries,” UNCTAD said.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-focus-on-5"">Focus on 5</h5>



<p>UNCTAD urged developing economies who want to grow their creative industries to focus on these five policy areas: &nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;<strong>Strategic policy development</strong>: Craft and implement policies that bolster the entire creative value chain, from content creation to distribution, domestically and abroad.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;<strong>Talent development</strong>: Invest in education and training programs to nurture creative talent and entrepreneurship.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Investment in digital infrastructure</strong>: Ensure widespread access to digital technologies to facilitate content dissemination and consumption.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Public-private partnerships</strong>: Forge cooperation between government agencies and private sector actors to drive innovation and growth.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Intellectual property protection</strong>: Strengthen and enforce copyright laws to protect creators’ rights and promote content monetization.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p>“Adapting these strategies to local contexts can help nations unlock the potential of their creative economies, fostering sustainable development and global cultural influence,” Henderson said. </p>



<p>UNCTAD supports developing countries with analysis and technical assistance so they can benefit from a globalized economy. It has 195 member countries.&nbsp;– <strong>Rappler.com </strong></p>

Quoting Hye-Kyung Lee, a senior lecturer at the Department of Culture, Media and Creative Industries in King's College London, United Kingdom, UNCTAD said ""freedom of expression and democracy is a requirement for the dynamic creativity that led to the Korean Wave.""       It cited the following policy developments:         1988 to 1993: Restrictions on key sectors of the creative industries - publishers, theater, film - were removed or reduced.      1993 to 1998: The Korean government continued the policy of ending censorship, ""which allowed creative producers to explore new forms and diversify their cultural outputs.""       1993-2003: The government passed several laws that ""clearly indicated a shift in the government's stance on cultural policy from regulation and control to promotion.""         ""Through this process, cultural freedom, which had initially emerged as a political issue, became a pre-requisite of consumer society and a baseline of cultural promotion policy,"" UNCTAD said, quoting Lee.       The report said K-Content comprises 11 areas:         publishing       comics       music       games       film       animation (motion picture)       broadcasting      advertisement       characters       knowledge information       content solutions.        A survey by Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism (MCST) showed the content-based industry of South Korea generating $108 billion in sales, growing at 4.9% a year from 2016 to 2020.      Among the examples of K-Content cited in the report are:         2020 Oscars Best Picture  Parasite                      Play  Video                        Netflix's  Squid Game   2021 drama                      Play  Video                       K-Pop:  BTS ,  BlackPink , et al                                                 Biases, comebacks, fan chants: A beginner's guide to the K-pop vocabulary                                                                                           K-Drama:  Winter Sonata, What is Love, Itaweon Class, True Beauty, Extraordinary You       Psy's  Gangnam Style  song and video        UNCTAD said that due to the popularity of K-content, the number of Hallyu-related groups is increasing by 7% per year and the number of members by 36% per year.       Citing the official government site  korea.net , UNCTAD said, ""Most of organizations consist of  K-pop fan clubs  such as ARMY (BTS's global official fan club) and BLINK (BLACKPINK's official fan club) although there are other cultural communities such as those following Korean drama, food, and tourism.""

K-pop idols attract audiences worldwide with appealing melodies and synchronized group dance,"" the report said.       In  K-drama , the ""themes are often universal in nature with simple storylines, while reflecting a wide range of complex human emotions, and employing new and innovative plotlines that are highly captivating to all.""              The report said the rapid growth of mobile technologies and social media since the mid-2000s was a ""decisive factor for the global expansion of K-content."" These ""reduce the costs and time needed for overseas expansion,"" and enable ""fans to help spread content easily,"" UNCTAD said, citing a study by four Koreans on the K-pop industry.       The study, ""Success Factors and Sustainability of the K-Pop Industry: A Structural Equation Model and Fuzzy Set Analysis,"" was funded by the Korean government with a grant from the   National Research Foundation of Korea.       Soft power      UNCTAD said the Korean Wave has strengthened the ""brand power"" of Korea, leading to expansion in other cultural areas.

Lessons and factors      UNCTAD said developing economies can pick up lessons from the Korean Wave and apply them to their own situations.      ""The Republic of Korea's strategic embrace of the creative economy shows how creativity and innovation can drive economic transformation and growth,"" said Marisa Henderson, head of UNCTAD's creative economy section, in a press statement.       ""It offers an inspiring model for countries aiming to turn their cultural assets and creative industries into engines of growth and development.""      Henderson said Korea's ""ascent to the global cultural spotlight didn't happen by chance,"" but ""was engineered by a strategic combination of government policy and private sector innovation.""      UNCTAD said a key to Korea's success was its ""comprehensive institutional framework"" led by its  Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism .       This government agency acted as the umbrella organization which coordinated the work of other bodies involved in Korea's creative industries including the  Korea Creative Content Agency , Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange, and the Korea Film Council.       ""Supported by trillions of won in government funding, they helped sculpt the country's ascent as a cultural titan,"" UNCTAD said.         ""The Republic of Korea's ascent to the global cultural spotlight didn't happen by chance. It was engineered by a strategic combination of government policy and private sector innovation.""    – Marisa Henderson, head of UNCTAD's creative economy section       ""Government financial incentives, including loans and tax breaks, alongside measures such as intellectual property protection, fostered an environment ripe for innovation and technological advancement,"" it added.       UNCTAD also stressed the importance of investing in education. In Korea's case, it said that investments in the Korean Academy of Film Arts, as well as the Korea National University of Arts, ""played a pivotal role in nurturing a new wave of creators who have adeptly used new digital platforms like YouTube and Netflix to reach audiences beyond national and Asian consumers.""       Jo Hyun-Rae, president of the Korea Creative Content Agency, said that ""through strategic investments and supportive policies, the government and the private sector have cultivated a creative ecosystem where innovation thrives and cultural products reach global audiences.""       ‘Unprecedented'      The report described the Korean Wave as ""an unprecedented phenomenon,"" since it now ""offers a counterpoint to the dominant western mediascape.""       ""The Republic of Korea was on the periphery of the global cultural content market, dominated by North America and Europe. Yet, the worldwide spread of 'Hallyu' the extent of which was perhaps surprising to the people of the Republic of Korea themselves, provides an example of how to capitalise on the creative industries for other developing countries as well,"" UNCTAD said.                                                Bond with K-pop fans at these Hallyu-themed exhibits, pop-up stores, studios across Metro Manila                                                                                         One of the ""striking features"" of the Korean Wave is that the appeal has been worldwide ""despite significant language and cultural differences between K-culture and many western consumers.""       It said the case of Korea ""represent a sea change in our thinking about what it is that international audiences are looking for and can appreciate.""       UNCTAD added that it's the digital age that has made this possible.        Different from West      Unlike the Western approach which the report described as free market (minimal government intervention) and mainly led by the private sector, UNCTAD said Korea's example was state-led and heavily funded.       ""At its core, the Republic of Korea's remarkable ascent in the content-based industry can be traced back to a comprehensive ecosystem, fostered by a coordinated nationwide policy approach, and reinforced by effective copyright enforcement,"" UNCTAD said.       ""The Republic of Korea's case is an example of the all-of-the-government approach for policy making and implementation linked to the development of creative sectors.""       The report cited Korea's Cultural Content Production Fund which poured $2 billion or P112.4 billion to the country's content-based industry from 2006 to 2021 or P7.4 billion yearly.      In contrast, UNCTAD said many developing countries have ""tended to reduce funding"" to its creative industries during hard times such as when the COVID-19 pandemic struck.       Mitigating risks      The report also noted that while government funding was initially focused on large companies, it has since also included small and medium enterprises and venture startups which, it said, ""are known to be an important source of creativity and innovation in the sector.""       UNCTAD said investments in creative industries are high-risk since it's very hard to know what content will click with the audience.       To mitigate the risk, UNCTAD said Korea established the Content Assessment Center which assesses the value of creative content.

2629708,department-agrarian-reform-government-land-displaced-boracay-ati,DAR chief orders allocation of land to displaced Ati in Boracay,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III has ordered the allocation of government-owned land to the 44 Ati in Boracay Island who were displaced following the cancellation of a collective Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) issued by the Duterte administration, DAR said on Wednesday, March 27.</p>



<p>Estrella gave the order days after the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/boracay-ati-seek-commission-human-rights-help-legal-dispute-land-developer/"">Boracay Ati Tribal Organization (BATO)</a> urged the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to intervene in the legal dispute&nbsp;between them and a land developer that had fenced off their&nbsp;property in Boracay even when the land ownership issue was supposedly still pending in court.</p>



<p>DAR said that according to Undersecretary for Legal Affairs Napoleon Galit, Estrella issued the directive immediately after the owners of the 1,282-square meter land in question reclaimed the property on March 26.</p>



<p>“DAR will extend all assistance and support services to all our agrarian reform beneficiaries, but we must uphold the law,” said Galit.</p>



<p>DAR said that Estrella wants the affected Ati to return to farming through the grant of agricultural land to cultivate, but did not provide additional details.</p>



<p>In November 2018, then-president Rodrigo Duterte gave land to BATO members through a collective CLOA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DAR said that based on its records, private claimant Digna Elizabeth Ventura, whose property covered the 1,282 square meters of land occupied by the concerned BATO members, filed a protest on April 10, 2019, against the inclusion of her property in the 2018 CLOA.</p>



<p>DAR said that its Western Visayas office ordered Ventura to provide a soil analysis test regarding the suitability of the disputed land for agricultural purposes. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-dar-decision"">DAR decision</h5>



<p>In 2023, Ventura presented a certification issued by the Agricultural Land Management and Evaluation Division of the Bureau of Soils, confirming that the subject land is “not suitable for agriculture,” DAR said.</p>



<p>Given the findings, DAR Western Visayas chief Sheila Enciso upheld the private claimant’s protest and directed her to file an application for CLOA cancellation before the Office of the DAR secretary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Galit said that the DAR chief issued a final order of CLOA cancellation on March 5, 2024, as the 44 claimants failed to show proof that would invalidate the DA certification.</p>



<p>“The petitioners representing BATO were unable to present any controverting evidence that would have prompted us to overrule the DARRO’s ruling. They lacked evidence to support their claim of occupancy of the area covered by the CLOA,” said Galit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Galit also pointed out that the filing of the motion for reconsideration by BATO was in default, DAR said. </p>



<p>In seeking the intervention of the CHR in their land case, BATO had claimed that the private claimant began fencing off the property in Sitio Angol, Barangay Manocmanoc in Boracay even &#8220;even &#8220;without formal court notices.&#8221;</p>



<p>BATO leader Delsa Justo had claimed that their appeal was still pending at the Court of Appeals.</p>



<p>Prior to the release of the DAR statement clarifying the legal questions raised by BATO, Daniel Dinopol , the legal counsel of Katutubong Aetas, had claimed that the dispute remained pending in the court as they &#8220;never received an order from the secretary of DAR <em> </em>denying our motion for reconsideration.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There are still remedies for the Atis,&#8221; Dinopol said. He said they will talk with the Ati community and respect their wishes on how to proceed.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-not-suitable-for-farming"">Not suitable for farming?</h5>



<p>In an interview with Rappler, Sister Inah Ellana of the Daughters of Charity who assists the Ati in the village, said that the private claimant &#8220;did not seek permission&#8221; from the Ati community in getting soil samples from the land for testing by the Agricultural Land Management and Evaluation Division of the Bureau of Soils. This is a requirement imposed by DAR on the claimant to support the latter&#8217;s bid for CLOA cancellation.</p>



<p>Ellana claimed that the land is suitable for farming, noting that the Ati successfully cultivated crops there and even supplied local hotels with their harvest.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;If hindi suitable ang lupa for farming, bakit nakakapag-supply ang mga Ati sa mga hotels dito sa Boracay? Matataba ang mga tanim nila,&#8221; </em>she said.</p>



<p>(If the land is not suitable for farming, how did the Ati supply hotels here in Boracay? They had lush crops.)</p>



<p>Ellana also scored the &#8220;forcible entry&#8221; of security people sent by the private claimant to fence off the property, as they refused to coordinate with their office citing orders from the claimant.</p>



<p>They don’t want <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/22638-condez-boracay-and-land-dispute/"">to repeat of what happened in 2013</a>, when Ati Dexter Condez, who spent years fighting for their ancestral land in Boracay, was shot dead by a<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/52191-ati-tribe-murder-suspect-arrest/""> security guard</a> after exposing this dark side of the island.  – <strong>With a report from Jed Nykolle Harme/Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>Tourism officials anticipate a staggering increase of 599.25% in Caraga’s tourist arrivals this week alone, attributed to the religious holidays, with the world-renowned Siargao Island being the driving factor, compared to the same period in 2023.</p>



<p>The projection is attributed to significant improvements that have made the region’s tourism destinations more accessible to travelers, such as the increased frequency of boat trips from the mainland to the islands and direct flights from other parts of the country.</p>

<p>During the 2023 Holy Week, the region only logged 5,454 tourists, a performance not so impressive given that the country was still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the poor accessibility to its islands.</p>



<p>Based on the DOT’s projections for this week, Siargao Island’s tourist arrivals would increase by 785.56%, totaling 14,904 visitors compared to the 2023 record of 1,683 total arrivals.</p>



<p>Island hopping has been one of the major tourism activities in Siargao, especially in General Luna town.</p>



<p>DOT-Caraga Director Ivonnie Dumadag said the number of boats for tourists has been augmented by pools of boat operators from other Surigao del Norte towns not known to cater to island-hoppers.</p>



<p>This, according to Dumadag, was enough to accommodate the surge of tourists visiting the beaches on popular island destinations like the tri-island Daku, Naked, and Guyam.</p>



<p>During last year&#8217;s Holy Week, General Luna experienced a shortage of boats for island-hopping adventures, prompting former Surigao del Norte governor and now town Mayor Sol Matugas to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/solfmatugas/posts/pfbid02GmXMQ44XdZvs7x4qGK9NZWP1WucssLJhf7ofnWBD7jmLZwTQBtHmGzpaG9mGRUtil"">apologize on social media</a>.</p>

<p>In Del Carmen, where the famous Sugba Lagoon is located, local officials said they have strictly enforced environmental safeguards and are prepared to regulate the number of tourists visiting the town’s tourism spots if needed.</p>



<p>Del Carmen tourism officer Leilani Lipio said as many as 1,500 visitors were expected in the town until Maundy Thursday alone, and around 2,000 to 3,000 more were expected on Good Friday and Black Saturday.</p>



<p>Lipio said they have already regulated the number of tourists allowed at Sugba Lagoon to 300 at most per batch or every three hours. Afterward, the boats either return to the tourism center or proceed to the two other island destinations – Pamomoan Beach and Kawhagan Island.</p>

2629476,dumaguete-bishop-julito-cortes-opposition-negros-island-region-revival,Bishop&#8217;s last-minute opposition casts shadow over Negros Island Region revival,"
<p>NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – In what appears as a last-minute twist, efforts to revive the Negros Island Region (NIR) through a law faced an unexpected opposition from Dumaguete Bishop Julito Cortes, who called the measure passed by Congress as an “insult” to the people of Negros Oriental.</p>



<p>Despite political optimism, Cortes&#8217; late opposition has injected uncertainty into the NIR&#8217;s future, sparking a debate and legal scrutiny as it approaches the final stages of becoming law.</p>



<p>On Sunday, March 24, Cortes said the Congress-approved NIR was an &#8220;insult to the people&#8221; of Negros Oriental, a pronouncement that rattled its local proponents. The bishop did not elaborate, and neither did he say exactly why he was opposed to the measure.</p>



<p>Cortes said an opposition movement against NIR is snowballing, and hinted at a forthcoming position paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The House of Representatives approved House Bill No. 7355 in March 2023, while <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/negros-officials-business-groups-jubilant-senate-approves-creation-new-region/"">the Senate approved its version</a>, Senate Bill No. 2507, on March 12, this year. The legislative measure, which is awaiting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.&#8217;s signature or veto, aims to create a new region out of Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, and Siquijor, including several cities.</p>



<p>The Human Rights Advocates in Negros (HRAN) have rallied behind Cortes, emphasizing the necessity for government officials to heed local concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HRAN criticized proponents of the NIR measure and legislators for lack of on-the-ground hearings and consultations, saying they went against democratic processes.</p>



<p>The assassinated Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo, who opposed the proposal, had cited language barriers as a significant challenge in reviving NIR, with Hiligaynon predominant in Negros Occidental and Cebuano in Negros Oriental.</p>



<p>Negros political analyst and lawyer Joemax Ortiz said the bishop’s opposition could lead to potential legal battles that could reach all the way to the Supreme Court.</p>



<p>Ortiz drew parallels to the nullification of a similar regional division in 1986 due to civil society activism. The NIR was also created based on an executive order by the late president Benigno Aquino III, only to be taken back by his successor, Rodrigo Duterte, due to budgetary constraints.</p>



<p>Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson questioned the timing of Cortes’ pronouncements, noting that those opposed to the Lower House’s and Senate bills did not make their positions known when Congress was still deliberating on the proposed measures.</p>



<p>Lacson and other prominent political leaders in Western Visayas, such as Iloilo Governor Arthur Defensor and Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas, favor the creation of the NIR, and see it as beneficial for Negrenses.</p>

<p>SHENZHEN, China – Chinese e-commerce vendors that want to sell products on TikTok Shop in the US as an alternative to Amazon are upset by moves they say the short video app has made to tighten enforcement of its rules for overseas sellers opening shops on the platform.</p>



<p>Chinese-owned TikTok, which <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/us-house-passes-bill-force-bytedance-divest-tiktok-face-ban/"">faces the threat of having to divest its US operations or be banned</a>, has in recent weeks taken a harder stance toward enforcing its internal rules, according to five Chinese vendors on the site and an industry association that represents 3,000 Chinese stores selling products online.</p>



<p>TikTok is requiring that US entities registered by sellers be 51% U.S. owned and chaired by an US passport holder, said the vendors and Winnie Wang, executive chairman of the Shenzhen Cross Border E-Commerce Association, China&#8217;s largest sellers group based in the manufacturing hub.</p>



<p>Many Chinese sellers had used US entities to be recognized as US merchants on the platform but the rules mean they will need to be re-registered as overseas sellers, which they say receive less prominence and support, putting them at a disadvantage compared to US TikTok sellers.</p>



<p>TikTok, used by about 170 million Americans, has been seeking to strike the right balance between pursuing rapid growth and managing regulatory risks.</p>



<p>It has been ramping up its rhetoric that a US move to ban the platform would take billions of dollars out of the pockets of creators and small businesses, while simultaneously seeking to catch up to bigger rivals such as Shein and PDD Holdings-owned Temu by signing up more merchants.</p>



<p>A TikTok spokesperson said the company has clear policies and requirements for all sellers on its shop, including for international sellers, and these have not changed since TikTok Shop was introduced in the US in September 2023.</p>



<p>&#8220;TikTok maintains robust policies to protect customers and promote a trustworthy shopping environment, and we continually strengthen how we enforce our rules,&#8221; the spokesperson said, without commenting specifically on whether international sellers get less prominence.</p>



<p>The Chinese vendors said they feel targeted by TikTok&#8217;s rules and some are thinking about reducing the resources they put into pushing sales on the platform or finding U.S. partners.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re rethinking how much of our time and resources we put into this,&#8221; said Shenzhen-based e-commerce seller Jackie Bai.</p>



<p>He and another seller said that in comparison, Amazon does not differentiate between US and other sellers on its platform, with all having access to its &#8220;seller central&#8221; and competing equally.</p>



<p>Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Bai and two other China-based sellers said they heard from TikTok Shop representatives that the tightening of the rules was in response to the political sensitivities TikTok faces in the US in an election year. TikTok declined to comment.</p>



<p>US officials have criticized the app&#8217;s security and privacy, suggesting user data might be shared with Beijing, but TikTok has said the firm has never shared, or received a request to share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-amazon-alternative"">Amazon alternative </h5>



<p>Chinese vendors selling products from beauty to clothing to housewares have rapidly grown their presence on ByteDance-owned TikTok&#8217;s shopping platform in the months since its US launch.</p>

<p>TikTok&#8217;s U.S. shop posted a gross merchandise value of $1.67 billion from its opening in September 2023 to the year&#8217;s end, according to an estimate from data provider YipitData.</p>



<p>TikTok said it does not disclose sales and did not reply to queries about the accuracy of YipitData&#8217;s estimates.</p>



<p>Sellers said they had sought an alternative channel to the dominant e-commerce giant Amazon and were also drawn by subsidies on delivery costs.</p>



<p>Some 50% of sellers on the Amazon marketplace are Chinese, with most concentrated in Shenzhen, said Wang.</p>



<p>These vendors, typically small businesses, submit applications to create &#8220;digital storefronts&#8221; and pay fees to the platforms for servicing their accounts and for advertising and delivering their products.</p>



<p>Bai opened a US TikTok shop largely selling undergarments in October and the platform was already generating 20% of his revenues by the end of February, he said.</p>



<p>He did not want to name his business or products citing fear of retaliation from the platform, but said his TikTok store had thrived after he hired U.S. actors to promote his products.</p>



<p>Bai said that a TikTok sales representative told him this month he would have to close his US-based entity and re-register as an overseas seller because he is a Chinese citizen.</p>



<p>Bai is now reconsidering his strategy and is looking for local partners as he believes this would disadvantage him against rival sellers.</p>

<p>With the upcoming midterm elections, propaganda and stretched facts without context that besmirch the reputation of politicians are being spread on social media to influence political views and election results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Cebu City, the ownership of Facebook page, Cebu Updates, is under debate. The city government alleges that it was originally a Public Information Office (PIO) page, now controlled by individuals to serve political interests.</p>



<p>While the illegal access and computer-related identity-theft case filed by the Cebu City government against Cebu Updates program hosts Erwin dela Cerna and Christian Tura is still pending resolution, this case highlights the issue stemming from the lack of social media management policies among local government units (LGUs) to establish their social media accounts as official and institutional.</p>



<p>In this December 2023 post, Cebu Updates used the hashtag #OurMayorIsMissing, and while looking for political leaders is normal, the hashtag used could mislead readers into thinking that the mayor is absent without valid cause.</p>

<p>Rama, however, during that time was in Australia with his family for over a month.</p>



<p>Rama designated Vice Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia and First Councilor Donaldo “Dondon” Hontiveros as acting mayor and vice mayor, respectively, while he was on leave, a vacation he officially declared. </p>



<p>While Cebu Updates page appears to be critical of Rama, it seems to be selectively friendly to other personalities in Cebu like Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD) chairman Jose Daluz III.</p>



<p>The page also promotes the activities of Panaghiusa Partylist, of which Daluz is president. Some of its posts show officials and members&#8217; visits to various barangays for dialogues.</p>

<p>Sought for his reaction, Daluz, in an interview on March 8, 2024, said that he has no control over Cebu Updates’ postings.</p>



<p>“It seems like Cebu Updates enjoys featuring us. You know with Cebu Updates, they seem quite interested in a lot of things,” he said in Cebuano. He added that he is not aware of the connection between his party’s Facebook page and Cebu Updates. He also said that they impose no restrictions on their page.</p>



<p>Daluz, a lawyer, earlier told the media that he is eyeing the mayoral race in the 2025 midterm elections, though he has yet to officially declare his bid.</p>



<p>Discussions about the 2025 mayoral race in Cebu City are, however, not confined to Rama and Daluz alone. Other probable candidates have also started to surface, such as former Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency regional director Yogi Filemon Ruiz and incumbent city councilor Nestor Archival.</p>



<p>With a following of 340,000 on Facebook, the negative criticisms launched by Cebu Updates against Rama could slightly, if not significantly, impact his reelection bid. Apart from potential damage to his reputation, Cebu Update’s posts against Rama also have the potential to shape the perception of Cebu City voters, leading to a loss of trust.</p>



<p>Some things to watch out for in the coming days are how the Office of the Cebu City Prosecutor will decide on the illegal access and computer-related identity theft complaint filed by city hall against Tura and Dela Cerna, program hosts of Cebu Updates, and whether the city government will succeed in regaining ownership and management of the Facebook page.</p>



<p>And what follows if the city does succeed? Will it shut down the page and delete all its posts when it is acting as Cebu Updates Facebook page?</p>



<p>The rift between Daluz and Rama, former political allies, is also no secret. Rama wanted Daluz replaced as MCWD chairman – initially by MCWD vice chairman Miguelito Pato, and then with retired major general Mel Feliciano.</p>



<p>Daluz, in a May 2023 interview with <em>SunStar’s</em> editor-in-chief emeritus and now opinion writer and columnist, lawyer Pachico Seares, said back then that Panaghiusa is endorsing Rama for congressman or senator in the next elections. This displeased Rama, given his bid for reelection as mayor.</p>



<p>Daluz, who said it was Rama who severed their political alliance, still leads Partido Panaghiusa, while Rama leads Partido Barug – which has been affiliated with PDP-Laban since 2018. Partido Barug formed an alliance with Kugi Uswag Sugbo and Partido Panaghiusa during the 2022 elections.</p>



<p>Daluz and lawyer Floro Casas Jr. are also no strangers to each other. Casas, who served as city administrator during the time of Labella, served as chairman of Partido Panaghiusa.</p>



<p>Daluz and Casas stirred some controversy when the former employees’ union of the MCWD in September 2022 questioned the alleged last-minute accommodation of Casas’ application for assistant general manager then. (READ: <a href=""https://www.sunstar.com.ph/amp/story/cebu/local-news/union-questions-mcwd-board-of-directors-over-last-minute-accommodation-of-casas-application-for-assistant-general-manager"">Union questions MCWD board of directors over ‘last minute’ accommodation of Casas’ application for assistant general manager</a>)  </p>



<p>Daluz, however, has already refuted claims of favoritism. Casas, in Seares&#8217; column on July 23, 2023, admitted being the administrator of the Cebu Updates Page. </p>



<p>Repeated efforts to get Casas’ side through phone calls, text messages, and Facebook Messenger chat went unanswered. We will update this story if he responds.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-no-policies"">No policies?</h5>



<p>The dispute over the former PIO Facebook page of Cebu city hall could have been avoided, had there been clear policies on responsible and secure social media use and management at the local government level.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, unlike other LGUs, such as the municipal government of Taytay, Rizal in Luzon, these are non-existent in Cebu City.</p>



<p>Given the public benefits of social media platforms and the potential for issues to arise from misuse and abuse, establishing clear policies can mitigate risks and dangers. This can help ensure that government offices are prepared to address any challenges that could arise later on.</p>



<p>According to city councilor Edgardo &#8220;Jaypee&#8221; Labella II, the Management Information and Computer Services (MICS) at city hall has not yet determined the number of departments and offices maintaining Facebook pages nor the total number of pages representing them.</p>



<p>Labella, in an interview on January 24, acknowledged the absence of established policies or guidelines governing social media accounts used by city hall. He, however, disclosed plans to collaborate with MICS on conducting a study to develop an internal policy or ordinance for the city government.</p>



<p>“My intention here is to prevent the pages from constantly being replaced because it’s an official page. Now, the problem is when the mayor changes, the (office’s) people also change. That’s the big problem,” he said in Cebuano.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-taytay-s-ordinance-778"">Taytay’s Ordinance 778</h5>



<p>The 12th municipal council of Taytay, Rizal approved on March 15, 2023, Ordinance No. 778 series of 2023, or “<a href=""http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/http://legislativeindex.online/pdf_files/Ordinance/2023/ORD778-23.pdf"">An Ordinance Establishing the Official Social Media Accounts, Platforms and Pages of the Municipality of Taytay and Providing Guidelines for Use, Management and Proper Turnover.</a>”</p>



<iframe loading=""lazy"" class=""scribd_iframe_embed"" title=""Taytay Ordinance778 23"" src=""https://www.scribd.com/embeds/717507480/content?start_page=1&#038;view_mode=scroll&#038;access_key=key-sONyIGRo78rQeouP4k5E"" data-auto-height=""false"" data-aspect-ratio=""0.75"" scrolling=""no"" id=""doc_78888"" width=""100%"" height=""600"" frameborder=""0""></iframe>



<p>The ordinance expounded on various aspects of social media account creation, use, management and proper turnover, setting policies on naming convention, agency description, creation and responsibilities of a social media team, content management and restrictions.</p>



<p>The Taytay municipal council acknowledged that the use of social media has become an “integral part” of the public and personal lives of the government and their constituents and it is “imperative” to formulate a policy that will guide government agencies in responsible social media use.</p>



<p>Likewise, although not LGUs, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government are among the national agencies that have established their social media management guidelines.</p>



<p>The DSWD, for instance, has its Administrative Order 16 series of 2021, which serves as the go-to guidebook for its social media managers and which outlines the agency’s rules of engagement.</p>



<p>“Mismanaged social media accounts by government institutions will be a sign of incompetence and poor public service,” it said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-ownership"">Ownership</h5>



<p>An expert on this issue, who requested anonymity, said a written policy clarifies ownership of a page.</p>



<p>Facebook, for instance, has institutional pages that allow verification. This means that even if an individual leaves, ownership remains with the institution. This measure also ensures accountability – especially if there are any errant officials who have left and will try to use the page for personal benefit. The institution can then go ahead and remove admin access.</p>



<p>Likewise, Department of Information and Communications Technology 7 Director Frederick Amores emphasized that a policy, in the form of an executive order, or better yet an ordinance, would help protect ownership of LGU social media pages.</p>



<p>“We can always send Meta copies of the ordinance and copies of the documentation. So, establish the verification, that’s what Meta needs to verify that you are indeed the legit owner of that page,” he said.</p>



<p>Data privacy lawyer Cecilia Soria also raised the issue of data privacy with the absence of policies among LGU-run social media accounts. She said the current administrators of the former PIO page should delete the information that the page collected when it was still acting as a PIO page. Its continued use as a private entity can already be considered unauthorized, she said.</p>



<p>This includes the information of those who liked and followed the page when it was still acting as a PIO page. But what should social media management policies or guidelines contain?</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-need-to-define-policies"">Need to define policies</h5>



<p>A study by University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication professor Clarissa David recommended that written policies specify the agency’s objectives, functions of social media accounts, and establish rules for assigning editing and administrative roles within organizations. The 2016 study was titled, “<a href=""https://cids.up.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Social-Media-Use-by-Frontline-vol.15-no.2-2016-3.pdf"">Social Media Use by Frontline Government Agencies: Review and Recommendations.</a>”  </p>



<p>It also suggested establishing rules on tone, voice, language, and style to reflect the agency’s brand, as well as the handling of crises related to social media posts.</p>



<p>The study also said that a written social media policy may also include rules on integration with all other digital channels; policies on privacy, confidentiality (tagging); copyright rules, policies on starting new sites, groups or channels; flowchart of complaint and query handling in the context of the organization, and monitoring and evaluation (that includes regular metrics and target-setting.)</p>



<p>David said in her study that written policies should apply to all social media channels, including Twitter, Facebook, blogs, message boards, image and video sharing sites, and any similar new platforms. </p>



<p>“It is not recommended that agencies have restrictive rules that extend to personal social media pages. In my own opinion, this infringes on the rights of employees to manage a space that is in their personal, not purely professional, sphere,” read a portion of the study.</p>



<p>“However, it is appropriate to put restrictions on any depictions of work product, office-related materials, identities of coworkers, and documents or sensitive information, even on personal FB pages and microblogs,” it added.</p>



<p>Running social media accounts, like Facebook, is now common in government work. It is beneficial as it has a service aspect to it.</p>



<p>Yet the need for social media policies is apparent, at least for the Cebu City government. Such policies can help prevent other local government public information office pages from facing the same fate as Cebu Updates – formerly a source of official city government announcements, now managed by unidentified administrators. – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>&#8216;Digital transformation&#8217; is more than just a buzzphrase; it represents a monumental shift reshaping countries and industries worldwide. In the Philippines, organizations turn to digitalization to strengthen their security, improve efficiency, and redefine customer experiences. The national government has also been proactively investing in digitalization initiatives to transform the country into a competitive player in the global digital landscape.</p>



<p>During Samsung’s business expo, “Innovations that Power Solutions” last March 21, Samsung Electronics Philippines Corporation (SEPCO) president Min Su Chu expressed optimism towards the overall digital transformation of Philippine businesses to become more efficient in their operations, as well as Samsung’s dedication to advancing the Philippines’ nation-building agenda through digitalization.</p>



<p>“The Business Expo is our concrete commitment to support the nation-building agenda of strengthening our government agencies and various business sectors to continue the country’s momentum of growth. We firmly believe that the time is truly ripe for Samsung to be doing this, with the Philippine economy showing solid performance in 2023, and the Asian Development Bank also seeing a further 6.2% growth in 2024,” Chu said.</p>



<p>Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Sec. Ivan John E. Uy echoed Chu’s sentiments in his keynote speech, highlighting the value of innovation for nation-building. Meanwhile, Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) president engr.

<p>DAVAO, Philippines – In the rugged landscapes of Davao City, Analou Anto, a 34-year-old indigenous woman from Barangay Sibulan, Toril District, navigates the dense forests fraught with peril – from the formidable presence of wildlife to the precarious terrain and the looming threat of illegal logging.</p>



<p>For about four years, Anto has been leading a male-dominated group, known as &#8220;Bantay Bukid&#8221; (forest watch), through the depths of their ancestral lands, undeterred by the challenges to safeguard their natural treasures.</p>



<p>“Going into the forest is challenging and risky. Dangers lurk everywhere – from wild animals to treacherous terrain, added by unpredictable weather and threats from illegal loggers,&#8221; said Anto, a member of the Bagobo Tagabawa tribe.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""2560"" height=""1707"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/SIBULAN-FOREST-GUARDS-scaled.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2629406"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/SIBULAN-FOREST-GUARDS-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1707&amp;zoom=1 2560w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/SIBULAN-FOREST-GUARDS-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1707&amp;zoom=0.5 1280w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/SIBULAN-FOREST-GUARDS-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1707&amp;zoom=0.25 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">TREK. Forest guards from the Bagobo-Tagabawa tribe on their way to work in Barangay Sibulan, Davao City. Ivy Marie Mangadlao/Rappler</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each month, her team renders 10 days to patrolling a strictly protected zone, a delineated area within their 4,000-hectare ancestral domain located at the Mount Apo Key Biodiversity Area which houses the oldest sanctuary of the critically endangered Philippine eagle, as well as the Sibulan River. The river is one of Davao&#8217;s eight watersheds that provide potable water to about 1.7 million residents.</p>



<p>Anto’s routine involves getting up at dawn to do household chores and getting her only daughter ready for school. Then, she hops on her motorcycle for an hour-long drive to meet up with 14 other forest guards at the drop-off point to start their patrol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clad in rubber boots, they assemble before starting their trek through steep, mountainous terrain. But their actual work doesn&#8217;t start right away. From the drop-off point, they have to trek for another two hours to get to their patrol area.</p>



<p>In the wilderness, they perform various tasks – they document endemic wildlife and plant species, search for signs of poaching and logging, and track evidence of deforestation which they report to government authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group also manages nurseries, replants trees by the thousands, and performs community services.</p>



<p>Anto said she became a forest guard in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions, redirecting from her previous job as a maid abroad. Her leadership skills quickly earned her the role of team leader among the forest guards in Salaysay, where she stands as one of only three women in the cohort.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve never felt being underestimated in the group just because we&#8217;re women. They&#8217;ve never seen us as a burden at work. And as the team leader, it empowers me to know that the leadership I offer and my voice matter to them,” she said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-form-of-empowerment"">Form of empowerment&nbsp;</h5>



<p>Balancing motherhood and forest guarding can be tough, but the single mother sees both roles as having the same duty: caring for nature as she would for her child.</p>



<p>On her regular days, Anto sells merchandise online and makes native coffee for sale. She also buys vegetables from her friend&#8217;s farm and resells them at retail prices to the neighborhood.</p>



<p>She said the income from selling goods sometimes falls short of meeting the family&#8217;s needs.</p>



<p>As a single mother, she views the honorarium she receives as a form of &#8220;women empowerment&#8221; as it helps her earn additional income to support herself and her daughter.</p>



<p>Each Sibulan forest guard receives a monthly honorarium of P3,500 for every 10 days of patrol work.</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Iron lady</h5>



<p>In Barangay Salaysay in the Marilog District, home to the Obu Manuvu tribe, another indigenous woman leads the group of forest guards.</p>



<p>Mabel Monkal, 32, is not only handling secretarial duties but also stepping up to lead patrols into the deepest parts of the forest.</p>



<p>Her colleagues often describe her as an “iron lady” for fearlessly confronting encroachers and illegal loggers.</p>



<p>When she joined the forest guards in 2021, there were only three women among the 28 members. Now, there are seven of them.</p>



<p>“We walk 18 kilometers, which takes about four hours. Sometimes we have to cross rivers and get wet. There are times we encounter storms, and get into accidents like falling into the cliff,” Monkal said.</p>



<p>Monkal and the other forest guards protect Mounts Makabol-Alikoson Conservation Area (MMACA), an 8,819-hectare conservation area crucial for the livelihoods of over 6,000 residents of Salaysay.</p>



<p>According to the Sustainable Davao Movement, MMACA is home to an ancient nesting site of a Philippine eagle pair, which has raised at least a dozen eagles since 1986. It also hosts other threatened wildlife species and around 40 bird species.</p>



<p>Monkal explained that MMACA overlaps with their ancestral domain, where endangered wildlife and habitats are sanctified as <em>pusaka.</em> For the Obu Manuvu, <em>pusaka</em> embodies the philosophy of securing cherished cultural items, animals, and lands as sacred and very important.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Facing threats</h5>



<p>To protect these sacred lands, forest guards endure the hardships of patrolling the mountains, facing threats from encroachers and illegal loggers.</p>



<p>Despite the threats, Monkal said it&#8217;s the rampant illegal logging that fuels her passion to continue forest guarding.</p>



<p>In 2021, Monkal and her fellow forest guards uncovered the cutting of century-old trees in the MMACA by a landowner with a Private Land Timber Permit (PLTP) issued by the Department of Natural Resources-Davao (DENR). It allowed them to cut 121 century-old trees to pave the way for land development.</p>



<p>Their report triggered <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/denr-xi-stop-the-cutting-of-trees-in-mts-makabol-alikoson-conservation-area-mmaca?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_31454771_en-US%3A3&amp;recruited_by_id=40af49a0-5673-11ec-a406-dbeba4264426&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;share_bandit_exp=initial-31454771-en-US"">protests from environmental groups and an online campaign</a>, urging the DENR to cancel the permit to protect MMACA.</p>



<p>Due to pressure from petitions, the DENR-Davao announced on December 9, 2021, that the <a href=""https://r11.denr.gov.ph/index.php/news-events/press-releases/1462-public-statement-on-the-issuance-of-cutting-permit-in-brgy-salaysay-marilog-district-davao-city"">landowner had voluntarily ceased tree cutting and promised to issue a suspension order for the PLTP.</a> However, no formal suspension order was issued, and the tree cutting only stopped because the permit expired on December 18, 2021.</p>



<p>Environmental groups in Davao City, such as the Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF), believe that if it weren&#8217;t for the report from the forest guards of Salaysay, the impact of devastation would have been even greater.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Inclusive work</h5>



<p>PEF collaborates with indigenous communities who live in the forest home of the Philippine eagle, as part of their culture-based conservation program.</p>



<p>Jayson Ibañez, director for operations at PEF, emphasized the importance of inclusivity in conservation, noting that “women, with their caring nature, excel in nature-based work and conflict resolution.”</p>



<p>“We see that they demonstrate competence in various tasks, from patrols to nursery management. We&#8217;re very happy about their involvement, affirming our belief that forest guarding is not only for men but equally for women,” Ibañez said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Encouraging others</h5>



<p>Both Anto and Monkal said they believe that there&#8217;s much more to be done in making conservation efforts inclusive, and they hope that by sharing their stories of indigenous women leading the way, more will join their ranks.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nurturing and caring for our environment isn&#8217;t solely the responsibility of one gender – it&#8217;s our collective obligation,&#8221; Anto said. –<strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

It also hosts other threatened wildlife species and around 40 bird species.      Monkal explained that MMACA overlaps with their ancestral domain, where endangered wildlife and habitats are sanctified as  pusaka.  For the Obu Manuvu,  pusaka  embodies the philosophy of securing cherished cultural items, animals, and lands as sacred and very important.      Facing threats      To protect these sacred lands, forest guards endure the hardships of patrolling the mountains, facing threats from encroachers and illegal loggers.      Despite the threats, Monkal said it's the rampant illegal logging that fuels her passion to continue forest guarding.      In 2021, Monkal and her fellow forest guards uncovered the cutting of century-old trees in the MMACA by a landowner with a Private Land Timber Permit (PLTP) issued by the Department of Natural Resources-Davao (DENR). It allowed them to cut 121 century-old trees to pave the way for land development.      Their report triggered  protests from environmental groups and an online campaign , urging the DENR to cancel the permit to protect MMACA.      Due to pressure from petitions, the DENR-Davao announced on December 9, 2021, that the  landowner had voluntarily ceased tree cutting and promised to issue a suspension order for the PLTP.  However, no formal suspension order was issued, and the tree cutting only stopped because the permit expired on December 18, 2021.      Environmental groups in Davao City, such as the Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF), believe that if it weren't for the report from the forest guards of Salaysay, the impact of devastation would have been even greater.      Inclusive work      PEF collaborates with indigenous communities who live in the forest home of the Philippine eagle, as part of their culture-based conservation program.      Jayson Ibanez, director for operations at PEF, emphasized the importance of inclusivity in conservation, noting that ""women, with their caring nature, excel in nature-based work and conflict resolution.""      ""We see that they demonstrate competence in various tasks, from patrols to nursery management. We're very happy about their involvement, affirming our belief that forest guarding is not only for men but equally for women,"" Ibanez said.      Encouraging others      Both Anto and Monkal said they believe that there's much more to be done in making conservation efforts inclusive, and they hope that by sharing their stories of indigenous women leading the way, more will join their ranks.      ""Nurturing and caring for our environment isn't solely the responsibility of one gender - it's our collective obligation,"" Anto said. - Rappler.com        Ivy Marie Mangadlao is a community journalist writing for Mindanews and an Aries Rufo Journalism fellow for 2023-2024.

2629414,baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-updates-march-26-2024,6 workers presumed dead after crippled cargo ship knocks down Baltimore bridge,"
<p>BALTIMORE, USA – Six workers were missing and presumed dead from a bridge that collapsed in Baltimore Harbor early on Tuesday, March 26, after a massive cargo ship crippled by a power loss <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-ship-impact-updates-march-26-2024/"">rammed into the structure</a>, forcing the closure of one of the busiest ports on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.</p>



<p>With dive teams facing increasingly treacherous conditions in the darkened, wreckage-strewn waters, active search-and-rescue operations were suspended about 18 hours after the accident, US Coast Guard and Maryland State Police officials said.</p>



<p>Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath said there was no hope of finding the missing workers alive due to the frigid water and the length of time elapsed since the accident.</p>



<p>State Police Colonel Roland Butler said authorities hoped to return divers to the water after sunrise on Wednesday in an effort to recover the workers&#8217; remains.</p>



<p>The Singapore-flagged container vessel named Dali, heading out of Baltimore Harbor bound for Sri Lanka, plowed into a support pylon of the Francis Scott Key Bridge over the mouth of the Patapsco River at about 1:30 am (0530 GMT; 1:30 pm Philippine time).</p>



<p>A trestled section of the of the 1.6-mile (2.57 kilometers) span almost immediately crumpled into the icy water, sending vehicles and people into the river.</p>



<p>Rescuers pulled two survivors to safety, one of whom was hospitalized. They and the six missing were part of a work crew filling potholes on the road surface of the bridge, officials said earlier.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-bigger-disaster-averted"">Bigger disaster averted</h5>



<p>The ship reported a power failure before impact, which enabled officials to stop traffic on the bridge before the collapse.</p>



<p>&#8220;By being able to stop cars from coming over the bridge, these people are heroes. They saved lives last night,&#8221; Maryland Governor Wes Moore said at a midday news briefing. The bridge was up to code with no known structural issues, Moore said.</p>



<p>There was no evidence of foul play, officials said.</p>



<p>Baltimore&nbsp;Mayor Brandon Scott described a scene of twisted metal shooting into the sky.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was something out of an action movie. It was something you never thought you&#8217;d see,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Video footage on social media showed the vessel slamming into the bridge in darkness, the headlights of vehicles visible on the span as it crashed into the water and the ship caught fire.</p>



<p>US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said closure of one of the country&#8217;s busiest shipping lanes until further notice would have a &#8220;major and protracted impact to supply chains.&#8221; The Port of Baltimore handles more automobile cargo than any other US port – more than 750,000 vehicles in 2022, according to port data.</p>



<p>General Motors and Ford Motor will reroute affected shipments, but the companies said the disruption would be minimal.</p>



<p>The 948-foot (288.95 m) vessel had experienced a momentary loss of propulsion and dropped anchors as part of emergency procedures before impact, its management company, Synergy Marine Pte Ltd reported, according to the Singapore Port Authority.</p>



<p>The Dali, owned by Grace Ocean Pte Ltd, rammed into one of the pillars of the bridge, according Synergy. All 22 crew members aboard the vessel were accounted for, it said.</p>



<p>Besides impacts to auto shipments, the port closure could force shippers to divert&nbsp;Baltimore-bound cargo from containers to bulk material. It could create bottlenecks and increase delays and costs on the Eastern seaboard, experts say.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden said the US Coast Guard responded quickly to the mayday call and commended the fast action of Maryland transportation officials who closed the bridge before it was struck.</p>



<p>Biden promised to visit&nbsp;Baltimore, 40 miles (64 km) away, as soon as possible and said he wanted the federal government to pay to rebuild the bridge.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m directing my team to move heaven and Earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible,&#8221; Biden said. The bridge, named for the author of the Star-Spangled Banner, opened in 1977.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-shocking-sight"">&#8216;Shocking sight&#8217;</h5>



<p>National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy said a team of 24 investigators and other agency personnel were on the scene but held off boarding the ship during search-and-rescue operations. She said personnel from Singapore safety agencies would arrive in&nbsp;Baltimore&nbsp;on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Jayme Krause, 32, was working a night shift on shore when the cart of packages in front of her shook violently in what sounded like an intense thunderstorm.</p>



<p>A co-worker at an Amazon logistics facility told her the bridge had collapsed and she ran out to look.</p>



<p>&#8220;I went over there, and sure as anything, it was gone, the whole bridge was just like, there was nothing there,&#8221; she told Reuters. &#8220;It was a shocking sight to see.&#8221;</p>



<p>The bridge serves as the main thoroughfare for motorists between New York and Washington seeking to avoid downtown&nbsp;Baltimore. It was one of three ways to cross the harbor, with a traffic volume of 31,000 vehicles per day, or 11.3 million a year.</p>



<p>The same ship was involved in an incident in the port of Antwerp, Belgium, in 2016, hitting a quay as it tried to exit the North Sea container terminal.</p>



<p>An inspection in 2023 carried out in San Antonio,Chile, found &#8220;propulsion and auxiliary machinery&#8221; deficiencies, according to data on the public Equasis website, which provides information on ships.</p>

2629368,cebu-officials-secure-ncca-commitment-return-stolen-boljoon-heritage-church-panels,Cebu officials secure NCCA commitment for return of ‘stolen’ heritage church panels,"
<p>CEBU, Philippines – The old pulpit panels taken from the heritage church of Boljoon in Cebu will be returned, according to separate assurances provided to town officials and Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garcia by heritage officials.</p>



<p>The assurance comes as heritage conservationists, church leaders, and local government officials continue to work towards the return of the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/panels-from-cebu-church-surface-national-museum-exhibit/"">church antiques</a>.</p>



<p>The National Museum of the Philippines (NMP) has scheduled a meeting in mid-April with Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma to discuss the issue of the four panels that the church claims were stolen from the Archdiocesan Shrine of Patrocinio de Maria Santisima in the 1980s.</p>



<p>The panels, believed lost for decades, emerged as a donation to the NMP in February by collector couple Edwin and Aileen Bautista.</p>



<p>In March, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) Chairman Ino Manalo, Commissioner for Cultural Heritage Ivan Henares, and Cultural Properties Protection and Regulation Division Chief Joseph Patrick Lee visited Boljoon to engage with town officials. Later, they met with Governor Garcia on March 13.</p>



<p>During the Capitol meeting, Dr. Jose Eleazar Bersales, the provincial government’s consultant on museums and heritage, informed Garcia of a commitment to return the panels.</p>



<p>Ino, however, told Garcia that “it is the National Museum that will make the final decision.”</p>



<p>Henares said they were looking into the legalities of the issue, as <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/boljoon-panels-deed-donation-document-national-museum-march-2024/"">a deed of donation transferred the panels to the NMP</a>. He emphasized that the NMP is bound by this document, which provides that the panels should remain with the NMP.</p>



<p>Lawyer Ben Cabrido Jr., a capitol consultant, earlier said the NMP could secure a waiver from the donor regarding the restriction to avoid violating the terms of the deed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Henares stressed the need to investigate the circumstances surrounding the panels&#8217; removal from the church, suggesting an inventory of all the items lost.</p>



<p>A former parish priest of Boljoon was <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/pulpit-panels-controversy-revive-theft-claims-former-boljoon-cebu-priest/"">accused of qualified theft and estafa</a> in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although it was unrelated to the loss of the church antiques.</p>



<p>“We can include it in the Philippine Registry of Heritage because they were asking us why there was no due diligence or they did not do research before acquiring the panels. But you have to remember that none of the church items have ever been reported officially as stolen in any of our registries. So I think that this is a good first step,” Henares said.</p>



<p>He anticipated the case setting a precedent affecting collectors in the country.</p>



<p>Garcia, meanwhile, reiterated her stance that the panels were stolen, emphasizing the need for a clear policy regarding church artifacts.</p>



<p>“Obviously, it was stolen because it belongs to the church. So any stolen item, even though years have passed and these were eventually officially donated, is still stolen,” Garcia said.</p>



<p>She said that unlike artifacts found during archeological diggings, the church panels are church property.</p>



<p>Garcia said she told <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/national-museum-cautions-labeling-heritage-church-panels-stolen-property/"">NMP Chairman Andoni Aboitiz</a> during his visit to the capitol on February 27 that the situation provided an opportunity for the country to put in place a clear-cut policy regarding items or artifacts belonging to churches.</p>



<p>Garcia said the NMP can retain the heritage items temporarily only if the church cannot safeguard them. However, she pointed out that Boljoon boasts a local museum and a passionate community dedicated to heritage preservation, therefore, the old pulpit panels should “rightfully be returned to the church.”</p>



<p>Manalo, for his part, emphasized the need to rebuild trust. He told Garcia that they went to Boljoon and listened to the sentiments of people, including the town’s mayor, Joie Genesse Derama, who expressed their frustrations and kept on saying, <em>“Gikawatan mi</em> (We were robbed).”</p>



<p>Of the six panels that once adorned the pulpit of Boljoon&#8217;s heritage church, four are currently with the NMP, one is displayed at the parish museum, and one remains unaccounted for.</p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – With the rise of whooping cough or pertussis cases in the country, some local government units have declared an outbreak in their areas.</p>



<p>Pertussis is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through droplets by sneezing or <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dG84-lxKLVmxrIgrsLIcVhHqXxCNufC6/view?usp=sharing"">coughing</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the areas that have declared a pertussis outbreak, as of March 26: </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-quezon-city"">Quezon City</h5>



<p>On March 21, Mayor Joy Belmonte <a href=""https://quezoncity.gov.ph/qc-declares-pertussis-outbreak/"">declared a pertussis outbreak</a> in Quezon City after logging <a href=""https://x.com/Teddybird/status/1772264517541744664?s=20"">25 cases</a> since 2024 began. The cases included five pertussis-related deaths, all of whom were infants aged 22 to 60 days old. </p>



<p>The city will administer prophylaxis for the &#8220;probable cases&#8221; or those who were exposed to those with pertussis. Meanwhile, Quezon City is also seeking to procure more pentavalent vaccines.</p>



<p>In a <a href=""https://x.com/rapplerdotcom/status/1771490994980008082?s=20"">Rappler Communities Chat</a> on March 22, Quezon City epidemiology and disease surveillance unit chief Dr. Rolly Cruz said most of their affected patients are children with incomplete vaccinations. But because the local government only has a limited supply of the vaccines, it is currently prioritizing those who are up for a follow-up dose of their pentavalent vaccine.</p>

Pertussis is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through droplets by sneezing or  coughing .      The Department of Health (DOH) has attributed the rise in whooping cough cases and other preventable diseases such as measles to the country's need to  catch up with vaccination , especially for children and infants.

In a  Rappler Communities Chat  on March 22, Quezon City epidemiology and disease surveillance unit chief Dr. Rolly Cruz said most of their affected patients are children with incomplete vaccinations. But because the local government only has a limited supply of the vaccines, it is currently prioritizing those who are up for a follow-up dose of their pentavalent vaccine.

<p>AKLAN, Philippines – The Boracay Ati Tribal Organization (BATO) has urged the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to intervene in the legal dispute between them and a land developer which had fenced off the Ati property in Boracay even when the land ownership issue remained pending in court.</p>



<p>&#8220;We, the Ati of Boracay belonged to Asosasyon sang Boracay Ati Tribal Organization, are humbly appealing for your assistance and support in our on-going legal cases and incidents of abuses and harassment with regards to the agricultural and granted to them by the Philippine government through the Proclamation Decree of the former President Rodrigo Duterte,&#8221; the group said through its leader, Delsa Justo, in the letter addressed to CHR chair Richard Palpal-latoc dated March 24.</p>



<p>Justo told the CHR that the land involved was given to them by then-president Rodrigo Duterte. The 3.1 hectares were divided into the lots through Certificates of Land Ownership (CLOAs) awarded by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to BATO on November 8, 2018.</p>



<p>In 2023, however, DAR-Western Visayas informed BATO that the government agency allowed several private claimants to file for the cancellation of the CLOAs. BATO has filed a motion for reconsideration  but the DAR central office denied it. </p>



<p>Justo said that on Sunday, March 24, the lawyer of one of the private claimants had a fence built in the CLOA that the latter was claiming, in Sitio Angol, Barangay Manocmanoc in Boracay. </p>

2629157,overstaying-ofws-kuwait-given-until-june-2024-avail-amnesty,Overstaying OFWs in Kuwait given until June to avail amnesty,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – Kuwait has given overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who have violated residency laws a three-month amnesty period to either adjust their status or voluntarily depart the Gulf state.</p>



<p>The amnesty period is from March 17 to June 17, covering overstaying foreigners, particularly those with Civil IDs that are expired or cancelled due to an accusation of absconding.</p>



<p>OFWs with administrative or judicial cases, however, will not be covered by the amnesty without the resolution of the cases, according to an <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MWO.Kuwait/posts/pfbid01Cgny5z1npPuX68EzJZNEvfGGz3kTR1gx4LUeoHDuUsYzJ6rGNJSpdnkzDQ9hrQWl?__tn__=*F"">advisory</a> from the Philippine Migrant Workers Office (MWO) in Kuwait.</p>



<p>Overstaying foreigners who choose to depart from Kuwait during the amnesty period will be allowed to return, subject to regular visa and entry procedures.</p>



<p>Overstaying OFWs who don&#8217;t leave during the amnesty period, however, will be subject to &#8220;penalties, arrest, and deportation, and will be permanently banned from re-entering Kuwait,&#8221; the MWO advisory reads.</p>



<p>The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) reported that as of Monday, March 24, the MWO in Kuwait has attended to some 500 OFWs with inquiries on Kuwait&#8217;s amnesty program.</p>



<p>&#8220;The office is also preparing to facilitate the repatriation to the Philippines of those who choose to return home,&#8221; the DMW said on Tuesday, March 26.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-status-adjustment-voluntary-departure"">Status adjustment, voluntary departure</h5>



<p>The MWO advised OFWs who wish to adjust their residency status to continue working in Kuwait to proceed to the Department of Residency Affairs of the Governorate that covers the address indicated in their Civil ID.</p>



<p>However, OFWs applying for the adjustment should take note that Visa 20 holders, or the domestic worker visas, cannot be converted to Visa 18, or skilled worker visas.</p>



<p>Visa 20 holders with <a href=""https://sandigan.icckuwait.org/knowledge-base/faq/how-can-i-know-i-have-ran-away-case/#:~:text=Absconding%20is%20a%20legal%20term,from%20one%20employee%20to%20another."">absconding cases</a>, or those who have been accused of abandoning their work or escaping, can only be legalized if they return to their employers who filed the absconding cases. &#8220;They cannot be transferred to a new employer,&#8221; the MWO advisory reads.</p>



<p>Overstaying Filipinos who have valid passports can proceed to the airport and go through regular departure procedures. They can also contact the MWO for repatriation assistance.</p>

<p>For decades, abused domestic workers in Kuwait have been running away from their employers. Sometimes, their employers sue them for absconding or theft. </p>



<p>The Philippine government has shelters in the country for these runaway OFWs – which the Kuwaiti government has a dislike for. In May 2023, Kuwait <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/kuwait-suspends-new-entry-visas-philippines-may-2023/"">suspended</a> the issuance of new entry visas for Filipinos, citing the Philippines&#8217; alleged noncompliance with their bilateral labor agreement. </p>



<p>One of the apparent issues was the use of shelters, according to Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega. But the Philippines maintained that the shelters were there to stay.</p>



<p>According to a 2018 Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/21/kuwait/philippines-protect-filipino-migrant-workers"">report</a>, domestic workers in Kuwait can be arrested, fined, or imprisoned for absconding.</p>



<p>&#8220;The <em>kafala</em> system can force workers to remain with abusive employers and punish those who try to flee. Workers who seek legal redress often have to do so without an income as they cannot work for another employer without the initial employer’s permission. Many leave the country without getting justice,&#8221; HRW said.<strong>  – Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>TARLAC, Philippines – The mayor of Bamban town in Tarlac is being accused of having  links with a Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) which was raided recently by law enforcers because of complaints of human trafficking and serious illegal detention.</p>



<p></p>



<p>A team led by the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC)&nbsp;swooped down on March 13, on the POGO, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/raid-pogo-compound-tarlac-march-13-2024/"">Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated</a> which had facilities right behind the Bamban municipal hall. The government now calls POGOs as internet gaming licensees (IGL<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/raid-pogo-compound-tarlac-march-13-2024/"">)</a>.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said in a statement Monday, March 25, that there were &#8220;damning pieces of evidence that Mayor (Alice) Guo might be involved in the operation of this POGO facility that is now implicated in various criminal activities. The DILG (Department of the Interior and Local Government) should look closely into the matter.” </p>



<p>Gatchalian filed Senate Resolution No. 977 which aims to conduct an inquiry on human trafficking, serious illegal detention, and&nbsp; physical abuse and torture allegations against the Tarlac POGO. </p>



<p></p>



<p>In a statement, Gatchalian said the documents obtained in the raid included the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>A Sangguniang Bayan (SB) resolution dated September 2020;</li>



<li>List of the 38 vehicles found inside the premises with one Ford Expedition EL plate number CAT 6574 registered under the name of the mayor;</li>



<li>A statement of account from Tarlac Electric Corporation II (TARELCO II) with an electric bill totaling to P15.111 million from September 2023 to February 2024 billing period.</li>
</ul>



<p>The SB resolution contained a letter of no objection which approved the application for a license to operate of Hongsheng Gaming Technology Incorporated made by a then private citizen Guo.</p>



<p>Hongsheng was located in the same POGO compound. In February 2023, Hongsheng was raided by the authorities. Three months later, its name was changed to Zun Yuan, per documents obtained by Rappler.</p>



<p>The POGO compound is on a 10-hectare property with 36 structures which included buildings, barracks, and villas, and  an Olympic-size swimming pool. Also discovered was secret tunnel, which connected the  three villas, according to PAOCC. </p>



<p>Since the raid, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/foreigners-filipino-face-criminal-charges-tarlac-pogo-raid-march-2024/"">eight foreigners and one Filipino</a> have been charged after the preliminary investigation through inquest proceedings. </p>

<p>“They are both church workers, environmental defenders, and community pantry organizers during the pandemic,” Non wrote in Filipino on Monday. “They recently opposed the tree-cutting in the area where a capitol complex in Pangasinan is set to be built. They have yet to be found.”</p>



<p>She was referring to the development of Pangasinan’s Provincial Capitol Complex, funded by a P500-million loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines.</p>



<p>Environmental organization Greenpeace denounced the “continued persecution of environmental and rights activists.”</p>

<p>Ana Liza Solis, climate monitoring chief at the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said on Tuesday, March 26, that their initial projection sees 13 to 16 typhoons by latter half of 2024. </p>



<p>It is important to note that this is still less than what the country experiences under normal conditions, typically averaging 20 tropical cyclones a year.</p>



<p>“During La Niña, we usually experience more typhoons because of warmer temperature of the ocean,” said Solis in a mix of Filipino and English.</p>



<p>In a La Niña event, sea surface temperatures in the western Pacific are warmer than normal, bringing more rainfall and severe floods. This is the opposite of how El Niño affects the Philippines, when sea temperature is colder, thus forming drier conditions and less rainfall. </p>



<p>Science Secretary Renato Solidum said on Tuesday in a Malacañang briefing that there is a 62% chance that La Niña will develop around June to August. </p>



<p>“And that percentage increases as we move to the later half of the year,” said Solidum. He assured that while the government is implementing actions to mitigate the effects of El Niño, they will later on transition into preparing for La Niña.</p>



<p>Because the warm waters are nearer the Philippines, developing storms have shorter travel time before  they hit land, explained Solidum.</p>



<p>“That means we have smaller lead time,” Solidum said in Filipino. “The storm is nearer, there’s shorter time to prepare. So that’s why we have to be really ready for incoming storms.”</p>

2628868,process-kids-aged-1-4-get-national-id,Here’s the step-by-step process of getting national IDs for kids aged 1 to 4,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) encouraged parents to register their children aged one to four in the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) and get their national ID.</p>



<p>&#8220;The PSA is continually making efforts to make the registration process child-friendly; our registration personnel are ready to assist our young registrants and their parents in the process,” said PSA Undersecretary Claire Dennis Mapa.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the step-by-step process.</p>



<p>First, go to the nearest PSA regional or provincial offices. Parents can also go to malls or local government unit registration centers. The parent or guardian must be registered with PhilSys first.</p>



<p>Registration centers are open to walk-in registrations.  Filipinos can also take advantage of PSA&#8217;s mobile registration activities for Geographically-Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDAs) or for those who have no means to visit any registration centers.</p>



<p>Present any of the following supporting documents:</p>



<ul>
<li>Certificate of Live Birth issued by the PSA or the Local Civil Registry Office (LCRO)</li>



<li>Report of Birth issued by the PSA or Philippine Foreign Service Post </li>



<li>Certificate of Foundling issued by the PSA</li>



<li>Certificate of Foundling or Certificate of Live Birth or Persons with No Known Parent/s issued by the PSA</li>



<li>Municipal Form No. 102</li>



<li>Philippine Passport or ePassport issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs</li>



<li>Any document showing the full name of the child, date and place of birth, the full name of the mother, and the full name of the father, if acknowledged</li>
</ul>



<p>The PhilSys Number (PSN) or permanent identification number of the child that will be generated will be linked to the accompanying parent or guardian.</p>



<p>After the PSA personnel validates the information of the child, the front-facing photograph of the child will be captured. When the child reaches the age of five, the child&#8217;s complete biometric information be captured, including the fingerprints, iris scan, and the updated front-facing photograph.</p>



<p>For children aged 5 and above, the PSA said registration activities are also conducted in schools to register students.</p>



<p>Registration services are also provided to Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) beneficiaries and their children during Family Development Sessions. </p>

2628828,philippines-submission-icj-advisory-opinion,"Philippines joins biggest case vs climate change, tells court &#8216;polluters must pay&#8217;","
<p>MANILA, Philippines &#8211; The Philippine government stands with the Pacific island nations in their bid to get the world court&#8217;s opinion that would provide a legal framework to compel the biggest polluters to pay those suffering from the adverse effects of climate change. </p>



<p>&#8220;Philippines proffers that prompt reliefs should be given and made available to affected States and peoples so as to immediately cease or mitigate any environmental damage,&#8221; the Philippine government wrote in its 45-page submission, filed by the Office of the Solicitor General to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague on Thursday, March 21.</p>



<p>Last week was the deadline of the ICJ, or the United Nations (UN) court also known as the world court, for UN member states to file their submissions, or make their positions known about the current request for an advisory opinion.</p>



<p>Lee-Anne Sackett, the legal manager of the Vanuatu Climate Diplomacy Program, said on Friday, March 22, during a panel at The Hague, that this is &#8220;the biggest case in history in terms of participation in the ICJ.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vanuatu initiated the resolution, which the UN General Assembly later adopted,<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/united-nations-votes-ask-world-court-rule-national-climate-obligations/""> to request the ICJ</a> for an advisory opinion. Essentially, the resolution wanted the ICJ to answer these questions:</p>



<ol>
<li>What are the obligations of States to protect climate systems?</li>



<li>What are the legal consequences for States that have caused significant harm to the climate system through their acts or ommissions?</li>
</ol>



<p>Climate change treaties have been around since at least the 1997 Kyoto protocol, but the years after have been filled with frustration on the lack of meaningful results that came out of it. This led the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to say in 2023 that &#8220;there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.&#8221; </p>



<p>The latest high-level negotiations in the Conference of Parties (COP) are focusing on the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/cop28-issues-finance-delivering-loss-damage-litmus-test/"">loss and damage fund</a>, a mechanism by which polluter states must pay up.</p>



<p>&#8220;[The loss and damage fund] is still more or less an empty bucket, there&#8217;s no recognized obligation on States to pay into that fund,&#8221; said Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, Vanuatu&#8217;s counsel to the ICJ, during Friday&#8217;s panel at The Hague.</p>



<p>The desperation has led to <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/environment/vanuatu-resolution-human-rights-impact-climate-change-united-nations/"">Vanuatu&#8217;s effort</a>, an initiative that was started by the youth group Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change (PISFCC), to bring this case to court.</p>



<p>The hope, foremost, is that ICJ agrees to issue an advisory opinion, which the Philippines supports. But meaningfully, that the ICJ&#8217;s opinion supports the stance that States who cause significant harm to climate systems must be held accountable.</p>



<p>Philippines invoked the &#8216;polluters must pay&#8217; principle, and said &#8220;while the principle is not explicitly referred to in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, many of the provisions and obligations stated therein point to the evidence that said principle is being applied.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When a State &#8211; by itself or through State actors or other entities whose actions or omissions may be attributable to the State &#8211; commits acts or omissions that do not faithfully conform to its international obligations, the same constitute a breach of an obligation and, under international law, is an internationally wrongful act,&#8221; said the Philippines team, led by Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, with inputs from the University of the Philippines (UP) Institute of International Legal Studies.</p>



<p>&#8220;[This] marks the welcomed return of the country in the proceedings of the ICJ, the last one having been decades ago,&#8221; said Philippine Ambassador to the Netherlands J. Eduardo Malaya, who personally filed the submission at the Hague with OSG solicitors.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-who-will-block-this"">Who will block this</h5>



<p>Because UN member states are authorized to forward their submissions, advocates are now watching which countries will block this accountability mechanism.</p>



<p>For example during the negotiations to adopt Vanuatu&#8217;s resolution to go to the ICJ, United States was among the few countries which expressed that a judicial process was not &#8220;the most conducive to supporting diplomatic processes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The US is a key Philippine ally. But in this regard, the Philippines disagreed that climate change is a purely a diplomatic issue that one can only resolve through political means.</p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless of the political aspects and dimensions of climate change, this Court cannot refuse to admit the legal character of a question and has the duty to discharge an essentially judicial task, which pertains to the determination of the obligations of States as imposed upon them and the consequences of their acts or omissions as sanctioned by international law,&#8221; said the Philippines.</p>



<p>Alyn Ware, who was a campaigner during the nuclear weapons advisory opinion process at the ICJ, said that when the ICJ decides to hold an oral hearing, or when the time comes that states can respond to the submission of other states, those who support a legal mechanism must be ready to &#8220;cut into the &#8216;yes-but&#8217; arguments.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have governments who say &#8216;oh yes we agree, we have to cut emissions, but we can&#8217;t do it too fast, it will destroy our economy, we will lose our jobs, there&#8217;d be many other excuses,&#8221; said Ware.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have to demonstrate that green economies are job creators, green economies are good for the economy, they can stimulate economic development,&#8221; Ware added. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-outlook"">Outlook</h5>



<p>Experts predict that if the ICJ decides an oral hearing, it will be by the end of this year or next year. The best case scenario is the ICJ issuing an advisory opinion that States can be legally held accountable for their acts or omissions that destroy climate system.</p>



<p>The worst case scenario is the ICJ decides it will not issue the opinion at all, or if the opinion merely refers to existing treaties.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;[That] doesn&#8217;t add anything, so then you shall have gone through all of this processes to be left with empty hands, that&#8217;s really completely useless, [but] that&#8217;s quite an extreme scenario,&#8221; said Singh.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;[That] would not only be disappointing for the purpose of climate justice, but it would be quite disastrous for international law and institutions because it would undermine the ability of the court&#8230;to address a problem of civilizational proportion,&#8221; said Singh.</p>



<p>Ware believes that the ICJ&#8217;s decision would not be that extreme, &nbsp;saying that &#8220;the court could only be going from moderate to fantastic, how close we get to the fantastic is what we&#8217;re looking at.&#8221;</p>



<p>ICJ&#8217;s advisory opinions have been criticized before as not having significantly changed things. That&#8217;s generally the main criticism of international law &#8211; when its orders are not enforced by countries who claim sovereignty, or just by countries who are powerful enough to ignore orders, and opinions.</p>



<p>The Philippines said &#8220;nevertheless, the issuance of an advisory opinion is not without &#8216;moral consequences which are inherent in the dignity of the organ delivering the opinion, or even of its legal consequences&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ware advised stakeholders to, as early as now, assume the best case scenario and &#8220;think about how are we going to implement the decision that will come out.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Philippines proposed a version of the Writ of Kalikasan. The writ, which was a unique innovation for Philippine law and a first of its kind in the world, is a legal instrument that compels actors to fulfill a duty for the environment. Locally, it can also come in the form of protection orders that could stop projects that are seen to destroy environment. </p>

<p>The case is a storybook narrative of bringing people &#8211; the victims &#8211; to the court, as states and other groups can submit testimonies from those whose lives have been impacted by the adverse effects of climate change.</p>



<p>The Philippines told the court it had incurred P497.45 billion in damages from 2012 to 2022 &#8220;due to natural extreme events and major disasters.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the island nations, &#8220;communities that had to relocate because of sea level rise [had] tendencies that they will lose their identity because in the Pacific, we are connected to our environment, to our land,&#8221; said Ilan Kiloe, the political and legal adviser of the Melanesian Spearhead Group. </p>



<p>Sackett said getting testimonies from Vanuatu communities have been a challenge because of logistics and connectivity. </p>



<p>Currently, there are requests for advisory opinions from other bodies, namely the Inter-American Court of Human Rights&nbsp;and the &nbsp;International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), expected to touch on the human rights component and the marine environment aspect of climate change.</p>



<p>The hope is to get good opinions from the two bodies, to lay the ground for the ICJ.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;If the advisory opinion comes out to be positive, it will assist the COP negotiations moving forward,&#8221; said Kiloe.</p>



<p>&#8220;The road will still be longer&#8230;I&#8217;m sure there are going to be testing moments, but it’s really worthwhile,&#8221; said Cristelle Pratt, assistant secretary general of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS). &#8211; <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

In the island nations, ""communities that had to relocate because of sea level rise [had] tendencies that they will lose their identity because in the Pacific, we are connected to our environment, to our land,"" said Ilan Kiloe, the political and legal adviser of the Melanesian Spearhead Group.       Sackett said getting testimonies from Vanuatu communities have been a challenge because of logistics and connectivity.       Currently, there are requests for advisory opinions from other bodies, namely the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the  International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), expected to touch on the human rights component and the marine environment aspect of climate change.      The hope is to get good opinions from the two bodies, to lay the ground for the ICJ.       ""If the advisory opinion comes out to be positive, it will assist the COP negotiations moving forward,"" said Kiloe.      ""The road will still be longer…I'm sure there are going to be testing moments, but it's really worthwhile,"" said Cristelle Pratt, assistant secretary general of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS). –  Rappler.com   ",Positive

<p>Outlawing borderline religious sects is never a black-or-white question. These sects typically use the guise of religion to exist. As such, the universal exercise of religious freedom that the Philippine Constitution also enshrines protects them.</p>



<p>However the reality exists too that many such groups have the potential to engage in illegal activities. Sociologists opine that religious sects become borderline and turn into cults when they are led by charismatic self-appointed leaders who require severe membership controls and piety to a set of rules considered deviant by society. Tennessee State University, in its presentation on <a href=""https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=7b33d5df643842a8875ff9f675ce6ae2"">Cults in America</a>, also made a similar definition and the usual profile of cult leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The religion sociology scholar Jayeel Cornelio made a <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-quiboloy-beliefs-and-why-they-are-dangerous/"">highly illuminative perspective in Rappler</a> of the consequences of charisma of Apollo Quiboloy. Cornelio posits that the Quiboloy worldview imposes upon his sect members a “high demand, high control” belief that results in pervasive fear among them. Followers donate money to him even if they are already mired in debt, so as to please “god.” Female “pastorals” alleged they were prodded to sleep with him because it is a divine privilege, that sex with Quiboloy is the “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/11/19/apollo-quiboloy-charged-sex-trafficking/"">will of god</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worldwide, there is an extremely adverse public view of cults. One such academic survey concluded that <a href=""https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/cults-and-law-discussion-legality-alleged-cult-activities"">fear of cults is general</a> and was specifically conducted way back in 1992 to explore the idea of outlawing them, because actual behavior harming people was present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such fears of cults are not unfounded. We can only look back to the 1978 Jonestown Massacre in Guyana, South America when 918 people in the Peoples Temple sect commune died after drinking grape Flavor Aid laced with cyanide. Its paranoid leader Jim Jones preached what he called “apostolic socialism” that was pro Soviet Russia. Using the approach of mass fear that authorities were out to annihilate the sect’s members, Jones effectively achieved mind control and the behavior modification techniques he borrowed from North Korea and Red China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jones planned the massacre cum mass murder that he called “revolutionary suicide.” The sect was also well armed. There was resistance from some members who refused to die, but guards of his so-called Red Brigade shot them. Jones would continually goad members that night of the massacre that “death is a friend.” There were babies and children. Jones had recorded the exact time of the massacre in what is now known as the chilling “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofbGZDbbUsE"">Jim Jones Death Tape</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What was the annihilation that Jones feared? He claimed a US government conspiracy against him, that the press had pilloried him, and that he was now “a dying man” because of all that persecution. The uncanny similarities to Quiboloy’s angry rants in his voice message on February 21, 2024 (since removed from YouTube?), resurrected fears of a mass suicide a la Jonestown, Guyana. In his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLfCAB3Xp5E"">voice message</a>, Quiboloy had also said that he was now “a living dead.” It was not unlike a mind conditioning statement for the benefit of his sect members to motivate them to support him come hell or high water.</p>



<p>The social pattern is typical: charismatic leaders turning deranged, as Jim Jones had. David Koresh of the infamous Waco, Texas siege of 1993 was also of the same dysfunctional mold. As head of the Branch Davidians, he claimed to be God’s final prophet on earth and that he had direct lineage to the Biblical King David. Yet the prophet slept with many of the sect’s women. He said his aim was to sire 24 offspring who will serve as the “twenty-four ruling elders” of the millennium after the return of the second Christ. One girl chosen to have sex with him was underage and was actually the sister of Koresh’s legal wife.</p>



<p>The practices inside the cult were, to say the least, bizarre. Koresh would <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20070124190128/http://www.usdoj.gov/05publications/waco/wacotocpg.htm#toc"">annul marriages of couples</a> joining the cult so that he would have exclusive access to the women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The psychiatrist who had examined 21 rescued children during the siege <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/us/growing-up-under-koresh-cult-children-tell-of-abuses.html"">concluded that the children</a> were “likely exposed to inappropriate concepts of sexuality,&#8221; and subject to &#8220;a whole variety of destructive emotional techniques&#8230;including shame, coercion, fear, intimidation, humiliation, guilt, overt aggression and power.&#8221; The children also said that “<a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/branch-davidian-childrens-drawings-foretold-deadly-waco-fire/story?id=52122314"">David Koresh was God</a>, and hence he was not to be questioned.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Koresh had also stockpiled weapons, the same allegation that had also been thrown at Quiboloy. When he was detained in the Honolulu airport in 2018, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/196131-pastor-apollo-quiboloy-detained-hawaii/"">rifle parts</a> were among those seized by US authorities in his private jet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Koresh admitted the multiple sexual relations, Quiboloy denies forcing his female pastorals into having sex with him. Among his accusers were <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/ukrainians-filipino-woman-accuse-quiboloy-sexual-abuse-senate-hearing-january-23-2024/"">two Ukrainian women and a Filipina</a> who said Quiboloy allegedly had raped them. The Filipina said she was only a minor when it happened. Quiboloy claims women run after him because he is single and is wealthy.</p>



<p>One problem in the search for illegal loopholes among cults is how they can change objectives at the drop of a hat. Because narcissistic leaders rule them, the “religious” tenets or policies they hold can change on a whim. We actually witnessed this in the House hearings on Quiboloy’s SMNI television franchise. His lawyer who was being grilled by congressmen suddenly announced that Quiboloy was no longer connected with SMNI, that he was just its “honorary chairman.”&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-accountability"">Accountability</h5>



<p>The distinct possibility that this was done to escape accountability is not remote. Unfortunately, this instead proved to be one of its illegal conducts – a franchisee’s change of ownership was not reported to authorities, a violation of the franchise.</p>



<p>While the idea of outlawing cults is a tricky one, there is also a general inability of most country’s law enforcement and criminal justice systems to disband them. And that is exactly what senator Risa Hontiveros is doing by breaking the ceiling – begin first with investigations and find out if Quiboloy’s Kingdom of Jesus Christ had broken laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question on Quiboloy is even a trickier one because he has taken up as part of his apostolic mission a populist pseudo-political aim: the support of Rodrigo Duterte and his dynasty, including their predilection for extrajudicial killings.</p>



<p>In the US, a private non-profit organization called the <a href=""https://culteducation.com/"">Cult Education Institute</a> assists doomsday cult members in deprogramming their conditioned minds to help them leave cults. But such kind of public assistance is absent in the Philippines where legislators often turn to mega-churches for political support during elections. Quiboloy claims he has 7 million followers. Whether true or not, politicians will be foolhardy to disappoint the possible support it can get during elections.</p>



<p>Bloc voting in the Philippines by religious movements such as the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) is closely intertwined with patronage politics and recognition for the group. In February 2018, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/196033-iglesia-ni-cristo-eduardo-manalo-special-envoy-ofws/"">Rodrigo Duterte appointed the INC’s executive minister Eduardo Manalo</a> as his special envoy for overseas Filipino workers. Ferdinand Marcos <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-reappoints-eduardo-manalo-special-envoy-overseas-filipinos-concerns/"">reappointed Manalo</a> in September 2023. Previously in 2009, <a href=""https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%209645.pdf"">Republic Act 9645</a> was passed, declaring July 27 of every year as Iglesia ni Cristo Day, a special national working holiday.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.controversyextraordinary.com/2015/09/iglesia-ni-cristo-bloc-voting-unbiblical.html"">Bloc voting is also a coercive practice</a> as prohibited by our Omnibus Election Code’s Article XXII Section 261 – Prohibited Acts under Election Offenses. It impinges upon the constitutional right of any voter to vote according to conscience without intimidation. Yet no politician has the guts to investigate the INC on it.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-criminal-activities"">Criminal activities</h5>



<p>The reality is that while cults are generally seen as legal on the basis of the constitutional right to freedom of religion, many such are actually illegal because of their aberrant practices.</p>



<p>Of the many countries that are facing the conundrum of cults in their backyards, we can learn from the European Parliament. Sometime ago, its <a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/workingpapers/cito/w10/page1_en.htm"">directorate-general published working papers to address cults in Europe</a>. While conscious that it is treading on the balancing rope of religious freedom, it uses a resolution adopted by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs in February 1996.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That resolution binds the European Union’s member states to exchange information on the conduct of cults in Europe. Then it calls on member states to do “the best way to restrain their undesirable activities and on strategies to raise public awareness about them.” For that it has set the essential context: Are human rights violated? Are political and religious freedoms violated? Are these cults devoting themselves to “murky or criminal activities and aimed to pervert the values and ideas which had built up and developed European societies”?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of cults involved in undercover or criminal activities, the resolution actually empowers member states to withdraw the grant of religious status. As a result, a line was drawn between freedom of religion and criminal activity.</p>



<p>The Senate’s order for Quiboloy’s arrest for contempt is the least of his problems. His bigger problem is the case of qualified human trafficking filed by the Department of Justice. It is a non-bailable crime. He can be jailed together with petty criminals and drug addicts. Once in jail, government can easily transport his whereabouts to the US once it succeeds in its request for his extradition. It is even possible that all his grand properties can be garnished by the state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duterte will be a paper tiger as property custodian once the International Criminal Court arrests him together with his daughter and his two fist-waver senators. The end of the Dutertes and of Quiboloy is crossly intertwined. And it must happen.</p>



<p>But it is also the Hontiveros committee’s efforts that can lead to the possibility of legislation for a thorough monitoring of sects and their criminal activities without outright outlawing them. – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

","<p>The Department of Social Welfare and Development has repeatedly warned against posts allegedly from the agency offering education cash assistance to the public</p>
",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/online-dswd-form-education-aid-fake/,2024-03-26T13:02:37,2024-03-26T13:03:13,"[712, 708]",FACT CHECK: Online DSWD form for education aid is fake,"   Claim:  The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) posted an online application form for its 2024 education assistance program.       Rating: FALSE       Why we fact-checked this:  Multiple misleading graphics carrying the claim were posted on TikTok and  viewed over 24,900 times as of writing.       The photos used the logo of the DSWD to promote its alleged 2024 education cash assistance program that offers P2,000 for kindergarten and pre-school students, P3,000 for elementary students, P4,000 for junior high school students, P5,000 for senior high school students, and P6,000 for college students.      The TikTok account that posted the claim, which has over 151,700 followers, instructed potential applicants to click the link on its bio that directs to an unverified external website that may put the public's personal information at risk.                  The facts:  The application form for the supposed education assistance is fake and not from the DSWD.      In a  post  on its official Facebook account on March 14, the agency said it does not ask for any personal information online to apply for ""educational assistance"" because it is prohibited under the  Data Privacy Act .      The DSWD also urged the public to verify the information they read online, especially if it does not come from a credible source, to avoid being victims of scams. (READ:  Phishing 101: How to spot and avoid phishing )       Fake application form:  The post claims to offer an online version of DSWD's  Social Amelioration Card  (SAC), a profiling tool the agency uses to identify potential beneficiaries for its  Social Amelioration Program  intended to help Filipinos during the COVID-19 lockdown.       According to the DSWD's  special guidelines , the SAC form is distributed at the barangay level and is the agency's mechanism for beneficiaries to access the government's social amelioration programs.       Education assistance:  The DSWD offers education aid through its "" Tara, BASA! Tutoring Program "" which is their ""re-formatted"" program that  offers  education assistance through cash-for-work interventions for low-income families.       Launched on August 2, 2023, the program aims to help low-income college students complete their tertiary education while engaging them in nation-building. Under the program, college students can earn P570 per day for 20 days by assisting Grade 1 students who are either struggling readers or non-readers.      Aside from the tutoring program, the DSWD also offers education aid through its  Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation  program.       Previous fact-checks:  Rappler has debunked fake education assistance programs supposedly offered by the DSWD:         FACT CHECK: DSWD does not have monthly allowance program for students        FACT CHECK: Online DSWD page linking to aid form for education is fake        FACT CHECK: DSWD has no scholarship program with P6,500 cash allowance        DSWD does not distribute 'educational assistance' directly to schools         For official updates on DSWD programs and services, refer to its official  website ,  Facebook ,  X (formerly Twitter) , and  YouTube  accounts.  -  Larry Chavez/Rappler.com        Larry Chavez is a graduate of Rappler's fact-checking mentorship program.

<p>MANILA, Philippines – Several economic bills backed by the business elites advising President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. are a step closer to becoming law after hurdling Congress deliberations.</p>



<p>The bill seeking to impose value-added tax on digital services, the E-governance bill, and the bill creating the Department of Water Resources and Services, which are backed by the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC), have been approved on third and final reading by the House of Representatives.</p>



<p>“As a member of the Private Sector Advisory Council, we help to urge swift action by recommending to the President the passing of key bills like digital service tax, E-Governance, and the Department of Water Resources. Establishing a national governing body for water resources is crucial for sustainable management,” said PSAC lead convenor and Aboitiz Group CEO Sabin Aboitiz.</p>



<p>The House approved some of the bills in late 2023. For these to be law, the Senate must pass its own versions. A bicameral conference committee would then reconcile the differences in the two chambers&#8217;  bills, both houses would separately ratify the bicameral report, and the enrolled bills would be submitted to Malacañang for the President&#8217;s signature.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-digital-services""><strong>Digital services</strong></h5>



<p>House Bill 4122 seeks to impose 12% VAT on digital services consumed in the Philippines. </p>



<p>This includes online platforms and media, search engines, e-marketplaces, and <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/things-to-know-philippines-tax-digital-economy/"">digital goods</a>. Online courses and webinars and subscription services for educational institutions are not covered.</p>



<p>The Department of Finance (DOF) earlier noted that this is not a new tax, but only seeks to clarify which digital services to tax. The DOF went on to say that it was not fair to only tax traditional businesses like restaurants, but not online platforms like Netflix.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>E-governance</strong></h5>



<p>House Bill No. 7327 aims to “transition of the government to e-Governance in the digital age”&nbsp; and create the Philippine Infostructure Management Corporation.</p>



<p>It is meant to complement other digitalization laws, particularly the SIM Card Registration Act and the National ID System.</p>



<p>Every government agency would be authorized to create a plantilla post for a chief information officer to check all tech systems are properly implemented and compliant with the law.</p>



<p>The proposed measure intends to create the E-Government Masterplan, which will be the blueprint in developing e-government services.</p>

2628855,police-intensify-barmm-security-christian-minority-observes-holy-week-march-25-2024,Police intensify BARMM security as region&#8217;s Christian minority observes Holy Week,"
<p>GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – Police have heightened security measures throughout the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), deploying close to 1,300 officers to safeguard crucial installations, including churches, during the Holy Week.</p>



<p>Brigadier General Allan Nobleza announced on Monday, March 25, that police personnel would rotate duties to protect land transport terminals, airports, seaports, parks, public areas, and churches where many non-Muslims are expected to gather in the predominantly Muslim region in the coming days.</p>



<p>The BARMM hosts the smallest number of Christians, predominantly Catholics, nationwide. According to the 2020 Census of Population and Housing by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), approximately 91% of the region&#8217;s inhabitants are Muslims, while around 5.3% or 261,963 individuals identify as Catholics.</p>



<p>The Brussels-based nonprofit organization <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/international-crisis-group-says-political-clans-pose-threat-peace-barmm/"">International Crisis Group</a> estimated the Christian population in the BARMM to be at least 200,000. Notably, areas such as Upi and South Upi in the two Maguindanao provinces comprise the majority of this demographic.</p>



<p>The Crisis Group also noted sizeable Christian communities in Wao town in Lanao del Sur, Lamitan in Basilan, and various villages in the Maguindanao area and the BARMM&#8217;s Special Geographic Area in Cotabato province.</p>



<p>Nobleza said the government also has a standby force ready for deployment, particularly in the provinces of Maguindanao del Sur, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, and Basilan, should the need arise.</p>



<p>He clarified though that there have been no credible threats monitored in the BARMM during the Holy Week, adding that the security measures are in place solely to ensure authorities can promptly respond to emergency situations.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, authorities in Datu Odin Sinsuat town in Maguindanao del Norte raised the alert level on Monday night following reports of an armed group allegedly preparing to launch attacks in the town center. Military and police authorities emphasized that they are taking such threats seriously.</p>



<p>This came after the Karialan faction of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) claimed responsibility for the March 17 ambush that resulted in the deaths of four soldiers in neighboring Maguindanao del Sur province. The faction <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/biff-warns-more-attacks-maguindanao-del-sur-march-18-2024/"">warned of further attacks in retaliation</a> for recent military offensives that have claimed the lives of several of its members.</p>



<p>Abu Sapyun, spokesperson of the BIFF faction, said they were out to avenge the deaths of Abdul Kader Animbang and Hamidi Animbang, brother and nephew of BIFF leader Kagi Karialan.</p>



<p>On Friday dawn, March 22, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/army-confirms-killing-biff-faction-training-chief-abu-halil-maguindanao-del-sur-clash/"">soldiers killed a senior BIFF leader, Abu Halil</a>, during an encounter in Datu Saudi Ampatuan town, Maguindanao del Sur. </p>



<p>Halil served as the training officer for the BIFF-Karialan faction and was a brother of Khadafi Abdulatif, purportedly the group&#8217;s chief of staff, according to Brigadier General Jose Vladimir Cagara, commander of the Army’s 1st Infantry Brigade combat team.</p>



<p>Brigadier General Oriel Pangcog, commander of the Army’s 601st Infantry Brigade, said their orders were to eliminate the remaining BIFF forces in their area of responsibility by the end of March. </p>

<p><em>Lawmakers in Hong Kong&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/19/hong-kong-article-23-security-law/"">passed new security legislation</a>&nbsp;on March 19, 2024, handing authorities in the semi-autonomous city-state further power to clamp down on dissent.</em></p>



<p><em>The law, under&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/19/what-is-article-23-hong-kongs-new-draconian-national-security-law"">Article 23</a>, has been decades in the making but was resisted for a long time by protesters who feared the legislation’s effect on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a special administrative region in China that has become increasingly under the thumb of Beijing.</em></p>



<p><em>To explain what the adoption of Article 23, which is set to be signed into law on March 23, 2024, means for the future of Hong Kong, The Conversation turned to Michael C. Davis, a&nbsp;<a href=""https://jgu.edu.in/jgls/prof-michael-c-davis/"">law professor</a>&nbsp;who taught constitutional law and human rights in Hong Kong for more than 30 years, most recently at the University of Hong Kong, and is the author of “<a href=""https://cup.columbia.edu/book/freedom-undone/9781952636448"">Freedom Undone: The Assault on Liberal Values in Hong Kong</a>.”</em></p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-is-the-background-to-article-23"">What is the background to Article 23?</h5>



<p>Article 23 has a lengthy backstory. It is an article in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/index/"">Basic Law of Hong Kong</a>&nbsp;requiring the Hong Kong government to enact a local ordinance governing national security. The Basic Law itself is effectively the constitution of Hong Kong. Its promulgation by the central government was part of China’s obligation under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 – the treaty providing for Hong Kong’s return to China. Thirteen years later, in 1997, the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-40426827"">territory was transferred to Chinese rule</a>&nbsp;after more than a century under the British.</p>



<p>The Basic Law established a largely liberal constitutional order for post-handover Hong Kong. This included guarantees of the rule of law and basic freedoms, as well as a promise of ultimate universal suffrage. It was formally adopted by China’s National People’s Congress in 1990.</p>



<p>Basic Law Article 23 requires the Hong Kong government to “on its own” enact certain national security laws relating to treason, secession, sedition, subversion or theft of state secrets, and to regulate foreign organizations.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong government first put forward an Article 23 bill in 2003. But due to concerns over the implications for press and organizational freedoms, as well as expanded police powers, the proposed bill <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-68594448"">met with widespread opposition</a>.</p>

<p>A group of seven leading lawyers and two legal academics, including myself, challenged the proposed bill in a collection of pamphlets that highlighted its deficiencies under international human rights standards. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3178339/july-1-2003-500000-take-hong-kongs-streets-protest-against"">half a million protesters</a>&nbsp;took to the streets of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>In the face of such opposition and the consequent withdrawal of support by a leading pro-goverment party, the bill was withdrawn.</p>



<p>Rather than come forward with a replacement bill that would address human rights concerns, the government opted to let Article 23 languish for two decades.</p>



<p>Then, in 2020, Beijing&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/hong-kong-national-security-law-10-things-you-need-to-know/"">imposed a national security law</a>&nbsp;that gave Hong Kong authorities greater power. It led to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/one-year-hong-kong-arrests-117-people-under-new-security-law-2021-06-30/"">arrest and repression of opposition figures</a>&nbsp;in Hong Kong, silencing the once-vibrant democracy movement.</p>



<p>With no effective opposition left and the threat of arrest for anyone who speaks out, the pro-Beijing Hong Kong government decided now was the time to ram through a more extreme version of the bill.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong government, with Beijing’s encouragement, was able to open up a short consultation on the new Article 23 legislative proposal with little or no opposition expressed.</p>



<p>The process was facilitated by a “<a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-patriots-only-election-falls-flat-with-record-low-turnout-2023-12-11"">patriots only” electoral system</a>&nbsp;imposed by Beijing in 2021 that has tightened Beijing’s grip over the Hong Kong legislature, leading to unanimous support for the bill.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">How will it affect civil liberties in Hong Kong?</h5>



<p>In tandem with the 2020 Beijing-imposed national security law, the new Article 23 legislation will have a dramatic effect on civil liberties.</p>



<p>The national security law – with its vague provisions on secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion – has already been used along with a colonial-era sedition law to arrest and silence dissent in Hong Kong. Many opposition figures&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/world/asia/hong-kong-democracy-leaders.html"">are in prison or have fled into exile</a>. And those with dissenting views who remain have largely gone silent.</p>



<p>The draft bill expands on the national security law in key areas: the stealing of state secrets, insurrection, sabotage and external interference in Hong Kong.</p>



<p>It essentially embraces mainland China’s comprehensive national security regime, which has long focused on suppressing internal opposition, targeting numerous areas of local civil life, impacting organizational, press and academic freedoms.</p>



<p>Included in Article 23 is the adoption of the mainland’s <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/asia/china-state-secrets-law.html"">broad definition of “state secrets</a>,” which can even include reporting or writing on social and economic development policies.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1220"" height=""1116"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/where-is-hong-kong-.png?fit=1024%2C1024"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2628823"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/where-is-hong-kong-.png?resize=1220%2C1116&amp;zoom=1 1220w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/where-is-hong-kong-.png?resize=1220%2C1116&amp;zoom=0.5 610w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/where-is-hong-kong-.png?resize=1220%2C1116&amp;zoom=0.25 305w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1220px) 100vw, 1220px"" /></figure>



<p>The legislation expands the potential use of incarceration with both lengthy sentences upon conviction and longer holding of suspects before trial.</p>



<p>Article 23 also intensifies&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/30/hong-kong-article-23-new-national-security-laws-explained-what-do-they-mean"">scrutiny of “foreign influence</a>” – making working with outsiders risky for Hong Kong citizens.</p>



<p>The draft legislation speaks disparagingly of activism under the guises of fighting for or monitoring human rights and is critical of “so-called” nongovernmental organizations.</p>



<p>All of this makes working with or supporting international human rights organizations perilous.</p>



<p>In short, in the space of two decades, Hong Kong’s liberal constitutional order has been transformed into a national security order with weak or no protections for basic freedoms.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">What is the wider context to Article 23?</h5>



<p>To understand this legislation, one must appreciate the Chinese Communist Party’s deep hostility to liberal values and institutions, such as the rule of law, civil liberties, independent courts, a free press and public accountability. Such liberal ideas are viewed as an existential threat to party rule.</p>



<p>This mindset has led to a dramatic expansion of the party’s&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.voanews.com/a/china-vows-to-safeguard-national-security-with-new-laws-at-conclave-/7520474.html"">national security agenda</a>&nbsp;under current leader Xi Jinping.</p>



<p>Beijing has emphasized economic development in recent decades, staking its legitimacy on economic growth – betting that people will care more about their standard of living than about political freedoms. But as&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/15/china-needs-reforms-to-halt-significant-growth-declines-imf-chief.html"">growth declines</a>, leaders’ concerns about security and dissent have grown, placing such security even above economic development.</p>



<p>This has led to the comprehensive national security concept now being imposed on Hong Kong.</p>



<p>With Beijing advancing an agenda that casts liberal, democratic ideas as a threat, a liberal Hong Kong on the country’s border became impossible for the Chinese Communist Party to ignore.</p>

<p>Having long nurtured its loyalist camp to rule Hong Kong, these loyal officials became the instrument of the crackdown.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">What does the lack of protest now say about the pro-democracy movement?</h5>



<p>It tells us that the mainland national security regime imposed on Hong Kong has effectively intimidated the society, especially those with opposition views, into silence.</p>



<p>Hong Kong’s pro-democratic camp had&nbsp;<a href=""https://doi.org/10.4000/chinaperspectives.5563"">historically enjoyed majority support, at around 60%</a>&nbsp;of the voters in the direct elections that were allowed for half of the legislative seats.</p>



<p>The introduction of loyalists-only elections led to a dramatically reduced turnout.</p>



<p>This and emigration patterns tend to show that the majority of Hong Kong people do not support this new illiberal order.</p>

","<p>In the space of two decades, Hong Kong’s liberal constitutional order has been transformed into a security regime that grants citizens few civil liberties </p>
",https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/what-article-23-means-future-hong-kong-once-vibrant-pro-democracy-movement/,2024-03-26T11:17:02,2024-03-26T11:17:08,"[763, 761]",What Article 23 means for the future of Hong Kong and its once vibrant pro-democracy movement,"   Lawmakers in Hong Kong  passed new security legislation  on March 19, 2024, handing authorities in the semi-autonomous city-state further power to clamp down on dissent.        The law, under  Article 23 , has been decades in the making but was resisted for a long time by protesters who feared the legislation's effect on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a special administrative region in China that has become increasingly under the thumb of Beijing.        To explain what the adoption of Article 23, which is set to be signed into law on March 23, 2024, means for the future of Hong Kong, The Conversation turned to Michael C. Davis, a  law professor  who taught constitutional law and human rights in Hong Kong for more than 30 years, most recently at the University of Hong Kong, and is the author of "" Freedom Undone: The Assault on Liberal Values in Hong Kong .""       What is the background to Article 23?      Article 23 has a lengthy backstory. It is an article in the  Basic Law of Hong Kong  requiring the Hong Kong government to enact a local ordinance governing national security. The Basic Law itself is effectively the constitution of Hong Kong. Its promulgation by the central government was part of China's obligation under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 - the treaty providing for Hong Kong's return to China. Thirteen years later, in 1997, the  territory was transferred to Chinese rule  after more than a century under the British.      The Basic Law established a largely liberal constitutional order for post-handover Hong Kong. This included guarantees of the rule of law and basic freedoms, as well as a promise of ultimate universal suffrage. It was formally adopted by China's National People's Congress in 1990.      Basic Law Article 23 requires the Hong Kong government to ""on its own"" enact certain national security laws relating to treason, secession, sedition, subversion or theft of state secrets, and to regulate foreign organizations.      The Hong Kong government first put forward an Article 23 bill in 2003. But due to concerns over the implications for press and organizational freedoms, as well as expanded police powers, the proposed bill  met with widespread opposition .

<p class=""has-drop-cap"">The Cebu City government on February 5, 2024, filed a complaint against operators of a Facebook page that, it claims, had usurped management powers of its Public Information Office (PIO).</p>



<p>Estela Grace Rosit, who has been assistant Cebu City PIO head since March, and who had served as the PIO head when the case was filed, lodged a complaint against private individuals Erwin Dela Cerna and Christian Tura, program hosts of the Cebu Updates Facebook page. She cited illegal access and computer-related identity theft under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (READ: <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-city-government-claims-ownership-facebook-page-files-cyber-crime-complaint-february-5-2024/"">It’s complicated: Cebu claims Facebook page ownership, files complaint</a>).</p>



<p>The case highlights the problems caused by the absence of social media management policies among local government units (LGUs) that could make their social media accounts official and institutional.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-city-hall-s-claim"">City hall’s claim</h5>



<p>The city government is asserting ownership of the Cebu Updates page – which had previously served as its official PIO Facebook page – and is bent on regaining ownership.</p>



<p>Rosit, in her judicial complaint-affidavit, claimed that Dela Cerna and Tura “unlawfully entered” the page without legitimate authority, as they are neither administrators nor officers affiliated with the city government PIO.</p>



<p>Some posts from its time as a city PIO page in 2017 are still accessible online as of writing.</p>



<p>A quick visit to the Transparency section of Cebu Updates also reveals its name change history, from its original identity as the Cebu City PIO page in 2012.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""828"" height=""1540"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/page-transparency.jpeg?fit=828%2C1024"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2628706"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/page-transparency.jpeg?resize=828%2C1540&amp;zoom=1 828w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/page-transparency.jpeg?resize=828%2C1540&amp;zoom=0.5 414w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/03/page-transparency.jpeg?resize=828%2C1540&amp;zoom=0.25 207w"" sizes=""(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px"" /></figure>



<p>The city government claims there was a proper turnover of the Facebook page from the time of Mayor Michael Rama in 2012 all the way to the succeeding mayors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it failed to compel the previous administration’s personnel to turn over the login credentials of the page to the current PIO. This failure was exacerbated by the lack, if not absence, of a written policy governing the city&#8217;s social media accounts.</p>



<p>The city government has filed charges against only two individuals visible on the Cebu Updates page, possibly due to lack of evidence or basis to include other personalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assuming they attempted to regain control of the page, the city government’s PIO likely knew who the previous managers were. The names of these previous managers, however, have yet to surface in a formal complaint as respondents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caesar Wenefrido Eviota, also known as Cerwin Eviota, stated in his affidavit that upon his appointment as Public Information Office head by Mayor Rama – following the passing of then-mayor Edgardo Labella in November 2021 – he requested the transfer of access and administration rights for the official Facebook page of Cebu City, then named as “Cebu City Public Information Office.”</p>



<p>However, Eviota claimed that the officer-in-charge of the previous administration, Razel Cuizon, “ignored and subsequently refused” to hand over control of the page.</p>



<p>Cuizon was sought for comment several times, but gave no response.</p>



<p>What’s clear is that the city government failed to regain ownership of the page and the current PIO has had to repurpose another page, renaming it “Cebu City News &amp; Information,&#8221; which now functions as the city&#8217;s official Facebook page.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-tool-for-political-propaganda"">Tool for political propaganda?</h5>



<p>The former PIO page has turned into a tool for “propaganda ruthlessly manipulated to serve the self-interests of its administrators,” Rosit claimed. “It has become a breeding ground for the spreading of fake news and maligning Cebu City government officials, all fueled by a relentless vendetta against the current administration,” she added.</p>



<p>Political propaganda, in this case, refers to the spreading of biased information, often with the goal of swaying public opinion and advancing a political agenda.</p>



<p>Rama, along with Vice Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia, are among the few personalities in Cebu City who have publicly announced their bid for reelection in the May 2025 midterm elections. (READ: <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-city-michael-rama-raymond-garcia-tandem-remain-2025-polls/"">Tandem of Rama, Garcia seeking reelection in 2025 Cebu City polls</a>)</p>



<p>While Cebu Updates aims to present fairly readable content, with some considered media service, it does not hide its dislike of the Rama administration.&nbsp;A majority of the 291 posts on Cebu Updates from February 8 to February 21 (posting period randomly selected), were Rama-related.</p>



<p>During that two-week period, the top five topics of its original and shared content were Rama- and city hall-related, with 73 posts, followed by shared posts from news and media organizations (61), entertainment posts (39), shared posts from government agencies (38), and public service announcements (18), such as traffic situation updates in Cebu, among others.</p>



<p>Other posts of Cebu Updates for this period included original livestreamed shows of its program hosts, including Dela Cerna and Tura, shared posts from Facebook pages of churches like the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral, shared posts of current and former government officials, and shared posts from business establishments and non-government organizations.</p>



<p>Moreover, of its 292 Facebook posts from March 2 to March 14 (posting period randomly selected), the majority, or 61, were shared posts from news outlets, followed by original posts (including prompts, announcements, greetings and promotions of products/establishments) at 53; Rama- and city hall-related posts (52); entertainment posts (34); shared posts from other politicians (22); public service announcements (on traffic, travel schedule, and school announcement) at 20; shared posts from government agencies and local government units (17); shared church-related posts (17), and Facebook Live of its program hosts (16).</p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCebuUpdates%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02qaQ95deL2D7c2EBH7EWmoF7D513pJUxFPZKQJXsume5RS6S6L8i84EViKmqF1Z53l&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""499"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>It is important to note, however, that most of the Rama-related and city hall-related content were criticisms of the current administration. Some of Cebu Updates’ posts openly called for Rama’s resignation, with a few of the page’s posts having hashtags such as #RamaNeverAgain and #SaveCebuCity.</p>



<p>Several posts also referred to the mayor of Cebu City as “toxic mayor.”</p>



<p>“<em>Mayor Mike Rama mo larga nasad daw ka sa Taiwan? Onsa man ka oy, wala najud kay pakabana sa syudad? Looy kaayo sige lang kag happy2x #SaveCebuCity,</em>” read a February 21 post of Cebu Updates.</p>



<p>(Mayor Mike Rama, are you leaving for Taiwan again? What’s wrong with you? Don’t you have any concern for the city anymore? It’s really pitiful; you just keep being happy-go-lucky. #SaveCebuCity.)</p>



<p>Although it now labels itself as a media/news company, the Cebu Updates page lacks fundamental journalistic practices, such as transparency and impartiality.&nbsp;The page, for instance, has not completed Meta’s verification process as of this writing.</p>

<p>The Office of the Cebu City Prosecutor has yet to determine if the complaint filed by city hall has probable cause.&nbsp;But in their joint counter-affidavit dated March 11, 2024, Dela Cerna and Tura denied the allegations against them and requested the Office of the Cebu City Prosecutor to dismiss the complaint for lack of probable cause.</p>

<p>The respondents said that contrary to the complainant’s accusations, they are not administrators of the Facebook page “Cebu Updates” as they are “mere talents or anchors invited to conduct live broadcast.”</p>



<p>“We also did not deliberately rename the page from ‘Cebu City Public Information Office’ to ‘Cebu Updates’ since we are not administrators of the page who are capacitated to make any such change,” reads a portion of their joint counter-affidavit.</p>



<p>Sought for comment, lawyer Shana Alexandra Perez of the city legal office, in an interview on Viber on March 21, 2024, maintained that there is probable cause to indict Tura and Dela Cerna for the crimes of illegal access and computer-related identity theft “because the complainant has appended all proofs to substantiate her complaint.”</p>



<p>Perez also said they brought the matter to Meta, Facebook’s parent company, to contest the page’s ownership, but they have yet to receive a response.</p>



<p>Tura and Dela Cerna’s joint counter-affidavit did not indicate who the lawyers representing them are, but a source privy to the information confirmed that the law office representing Tura and Dela Cerna is the E.C Labella and Partners Law Office.</p>



<p>A copy of the Motion for Extension of Time to File Counter-Affidavit, signed and filed by lawyers Niño Anthony Silvestrece and Janica Tujan of E.C Labella, indicated they serve as legal counsel for Dela Cerna.</p>



<p>According to the motion for extension, Dela Cerna received a copy of an order dated February 12 on February 20, directing him to submit his counter-affidavit and other supporting evidence or documents to refute the complainant’s evidence within 10 days, or by March 1, upon receipt.</p>



<p>However, Dela Cerna’s lawyers, in the motion for extension, said they had just been recently engaged to represent Dela Cerna in the case, and due to time constraints, requested a 10-day extension until March 11.</p>



<p>Jerone Castillo, former city attorney leading the city legal office in this case, in earlier interviews, said cases will soon be filed against more individuals.</p>



<p>Interviews were sought with other individuals who had been seen doing <a href=""https://fb.watch/qWtUmPvl4b/"">live broadcasts</a> on the Cebu Updates’ page, including a certain Jun Tumulak, “Dagmasla Zeus Sebastian,” and lawyer Floro Casas Jr., who was city administrator during the time of the late mayor Edgardo Labella, but to no avail.</p>

Estela Grace Rosit, who has been assistant Cebu City PIO head since March, and who had served as the PIO head when the case was filed, lodged a complaint against private individuals Erwin Dela Cerna and Christian Tura, program hosts of the Cebu Updates Facebook page. She cited illegal access and computer-related identity theft under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (READ:  It's complicated: Cebu claims Facebook page ownership, files complaint ).      The case highlights the problems caused by the absence of social media management policies among local government units (LGUs) that could make their social media accounts official and institutional.      City hall's claim      The city government is asserting ownership of the Cebu Updates page - which had previously served as its official PIO Facebook page - and is bent on regaining ownership.      Rosit, in her judicial complaint-affidavit, claimed that Dela Cerna and Tura ""unlawfully entered"" the page without legitimate authority, as they are neither administrators nor officers affiliated with the city government PIO.      Some posts from its time as a city PIO page in 2017 are still accessible online as of writing.      A quick visit to the Transparency section of Cebu Updates also reveals its name change history, from its original identity as the Cebu City PIO page in 2012.             The city government claims there was a proper turnover of the Facebook page from the time of Mayor Michael Rama in 2012 all the way to the succeeding mayors.       However, it failed to compel the previous administration's personnel to turn over the login credentials of the page to the current PIO. This failure was exacerbated by the lack, if not absence, of a written policy governing the city's social media accounts.      The city government has filed charges against only two individuals visible on the Cebu Updates page, possibly due to lack of evidence or basis to include other personalities.       Assuming they attempted to regain control of the page, the city government's PIO likely knew who the previous managers were. The names of these previous managers, however, have yet to surface in a formal complaint as respondents.       Caesar Wenefrido Eviota, also known as Cerwin Eviota, stated in his affidavit that upon his appointment as Public Information Office head by Mayor Rama - following the passing of then-mayor Edgardo Labella in November 2021 - he requested the transfer of access and administration rights for the official Facebook page of Cebu City, then named as ""Cebu City Public Information Office.""      However, Eviota claimed that the officer-in-charge of the previous administration, Razel Cuizon, ""ignored and subsequently refused"" to hand over control of the page.      Cuizon was sought for comment several times, but gave no response.      What's clear is that the city government failed to regain ownership of the page and the current PIO has had to repurpose another page, renaming it ""Cebu City News & Information,"" which now functions as the city's official Facebook page.      Tool for political propaganda?      The former PIO page has turned into a tool for ""propaganda ruthlessly manipulated to serve the self-interests of its administrators,"" Rosit claimed. ""It has become a breeding ground for the spreading of fake news and maligning Cebu City government officials, all fueled by a relentless vendetta against the current administration,"" she added.      Political propaganda, in this case, refers to the spreading of biased information, often with the goal of swaying public opinion and advancing a political agenda.      Rama, along with Vice Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia, are among the few personalities in Cebu City who have publicly announced their bid for reelection in the May 2025 midterm elections. (READ:  Tandem of Rama, Garcia seeking reelection in 2025 Cebu City polls )      While Cebu Updates aims to present fairly readable content, with some considered media service, it does not hide its dislike of the Rama administration. A majority of the 291 posts on Cebu Updates from February 8 to February 21 (posting period randomly selected), were Rama-related.      During that two-week period, the top five topics of its original and shared content were Rama- and city hall-related, with 73 posts, followed by shared posts from news and media organizations (61), entertainment posts (39), shared posts from government agencies (38), and public service announcements (18), such as traffic situation updates in Cebu, among others.      Other posts of Cebu Updates for this period included original livestreamed shows of its program hosts, including Dela Cerna and Tura, shared posts from Facebook pages of churches like the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral, shared posts of current and former government officials, and shared posts from business establishments and non-government organizations.      Moreover, of its 292 Facebook posts from March 2 to March 14 (posting period randomly selected), the majority, or 61, were shared posts from news outlets, followed by original posts (including prompts, announcements, greetings and promotions of products/establishments) at 53; Rama- and city hall-related posts (52); entertainment posts (34); shared posts from other politicians (22); public service announcements (on traffic, travel schedule, and school announcement) at 20; shared posts from government agencies and local government units (17); shared church-related posts (17), and Facebook Live of its program hosts (16).              It is important to note, however, that most of the Rama-related and city hall-related content were criticisms of the current administration. Some of Cebu Updates' posts openly called for Rama's resignation, with a few of the page's posts having hashtags such as #RamaNeverAgain and #SaveCebuCity.      Several posts also referred to the mayor of Cebu City as ""toxic mayor.""      "" Mayor Mike Rama mo larga nasad daw ka sa Taiwan? Onsa man ka oy, wala najud kay pakabana sa syudad? Looy kaayo sige lang kag happy2x #SaveCebuCity, "" read a February 21 post of Cebu Updates.      (Mayor Mike Rama, are you leaving for Taiwan again? What's wrong with you? Don't you have any concern for the city anymore? It's really pitiful; you just keep being happy-go-lucky. #SaveCebuCity.)      Although it now labels itself as a media/news company, the Cebu Updates page lacks fundamental journalistic practices, such as transparency and impartiality. The page, for instance, has not completed Meta's verification process as of this writing.             Cebu Updates' defense      The Cebu Updates page earlier said the case will not hinder it from ""fearlessly"" sharing issues in Cebu and other parts of the world. (READ:  FB page won't stop exposing CH anomalies )      ""Rest assured that this case will not stop us from fearlessly sharing with you the hottest issues, news, & tsismiz in Cebu, the Philippines & the world,"" it said in a February 9 post.

2628673,opinion-weaving-ethics-all-subject-areas-education-system,[OPINION] Education for life: Weaving ethics in all subject areas,"
<p>Education has been made synonymous with acquiring skills – to read and write, to count, and to acquire knowledge from different domains. In the Philippines, many would argue that we teach too many subjects that end up not being used later on in students’ careers. But I would like to pause there: Why are we preparing students for their careers and not their lives as a whole?</p>



<p>Skills are important for productivity and industry, but they only equip us to perform tasks, not guide us on how to live our lives. Medical doctors learn how to cure diseases and save lives through their training in medical school, but how they treat their patients with fairness, justice, and compassion is learned primarily outside of the formal education system.</p>



<p>Ethics deals with the concepts of right and wrong, good and bad, and how we should live our lives. As a formal institution that aims to hone the youth into productive citizens, the classroom stands as an authority in persuading and forming beliefs surrounding these concepts. Yet, without an explicit focus on ethics, we risk creating individuals highly skilled in their domains but ill-equipped to navigate the moral complexities of everyday life.</p>



<p>Paulo Freire, the founding figure for critical pedagogy, emphasizes the need to shift away from a model of education that treats students merely as vessels waiting to be filled with knowledge, to a model that encourages students to pose problems and questions. Through dialogue with their teachers, students become agents capable of producing knowledge.</p>



<p>In the Philippines, ethics is taught as a single and separate domain – that is, values education in basic education and philosophy in the tertiary level). Here’s my proposal: Pose ethical questions as part of every knowledge domain. This doesn&#8217;t mean turning every class into a philosophy seminar, but rather finding creative ways to integrate ethical considerations into existing subjects.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-practical-examples""><strong>Practical examples</strong></h5>



<p>For example, in a chemistry class, we can incorporate ethical questions on the environmental impact of specific chemicals and the responsibility scientists have in developing sustainable solutions. When teaching algebra, we can raise concerns about the ethical use of algorithms in the modern world, exploring issues of bias and how they might perpetuate social inequalities. In geometry lessons, we could discuss how geometrical principles might shape urban planning, leading to discussions on equitable infrastructure design and responsible land use.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s extend this to other domains. History lessons could touch upon the ethics of historical representation, encouraging students to grapple with different perspectives and narratives. Literature classes could delve into the ethical dilemmas faced by characters, fostering empathy and understanding of complex human motivations. Even physical education could introduce discussions on sportsmanship, teamwork, and the ethics of competition.</p>



<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not enough to just pose the questions. We need to equip students with the thinking tools to tackle these ethical dilemmas. This could involve introducing them to different ethical frameworks (like utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics), encouraging them to consider various perspectives, and fostering a culture of respectful debate and dialogue in the classroom. The goal is not to provide easy answers, but to cultivate a habit of mindful deliberation about the moral choices that technology, science, mathematics, and the very act of learning inevitably raise.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-developing-skills-for-discernment"">Developing skills for discernment</h5>



<p>Some might argue that incorporating ethics into already packed curricula is unrealistic. However, I believe that ethical considerations can be woven seamlessly into existing lessons without sacrificing essential content knowledge. Moreover, by fostering critical thinking and ethical awareness, we&#8217;re ultimately preparing students for success in all areas of life, not just their careers.</p>



<p>Others might worry that discussions of ethics will become overly subjective or lead to indoctrination. This concern is valid, but it highlights the importance of teacher training and careful lesson planning. By grounding ethical discussions in well-established frameworks, fostering respectful dialogue, and emphasizing the importance of reasoned argumentation, we can create a learning environment that encourages thoughtful reflection without imposing a single viewpoint.</p>



<p>By weaving ethics seamlessly into existing curricula, we make it an integral part of the learning process, rather than an abstract add-on. This approach can help students develop a sense of ethical responsibility alongside technical proficiency, empowering them to become critical thinkers and engaged citizens.</p>



<p>Certainly, there are potential challenges. Teachers will need the resources and training, and there&#8217;s a risk of politicization. Careful planning, thoughtful facilitation, and a focus on civil discourse will be crucial.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this change will constitute a paradigm shift – one that is crucial if we are to save ourselves from the growing injustices of the world we live in. Education should not be just about preparing students for the workforce, but for life itself. By making ethical reflection a cornerstone of our educational system, we foster a generation capable not only of doing things well, but of doing the right thing. <strong>– Rappler.com </strong></p>

",https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-weaving-ethics-all-subject-areas-education-system/,2024-03-26T09:00:00,2024-03-25T22:32:53,"[757, 755]",[OPINION] Education for life: Weaving ethics in all subject areas,"  Education has been made synonymous with acquiring skills - to read and write, to count, and to acquire knowledge from different domains. In the Philippines, many would argue that we teach too many subjects that end up not being used later on in students' careers. But I would like to pause there: Why are we preparing students for their careers and not their lives as a whole?      Skills are important for productivity and industry, but they only equip us to perform tasks, not guide us on how to live our lives. Medical doctors learn how to cure diseases and save lives through their training in medical school, but how they treat their patients with fairness, justice, and compassion is learned primarily outside of the formal education system.      Ethics deals with the concepts of right and wrong, good and bad, and how we should live our lives. As a formal institution that aims to hone the youth into productive citizens, the classroom stands as an authority in persuading and forming beliefs surrounding these concepts. Yet, without an explicit focus on ethics, we risk creating individuals highly skilled in their domains but ill-equipped to navigate the moral complexities of everyday life.      Paulo Freire, the founding figure for critical pedagogy, emphasizes the need to shift away from a model of education that treats students merely as vessels waiting to be filled with knowledge, to a model that encourages students to pose problems and questions. Through dialogue with their teachers, students become agents capable of producing knowledge.      In the Philippines, ethics is taught as a single and separate domain - that is, values education in basic education and philosophy in the tertiary level). Here's my proposal: Pose ethical questions as part of every knowledge domain. This doesn't mean turning every class into a philosophy seminar, but rather finding creative ways to integrate ethical considerations into existing subjects.       Practical examples       For example, in a chemistry class, we can incorporate ethical questions on the environmental impact of specific chemicals and the responsibility scientists have in developing sustainable solutions. When teaching algebra, we can raise concerns about the ethical use of algorithms in the modern world, exploring issues of bias and how they might perpetuate social inequalities. In geometry lessons, we could discuss how geometrical principles might shape urban planning, leading to discussions on equitable infrastructure design and responsible land use.      Let's extend this to other domains. History lessons could touch upon the ethics of historical representation, encouraging students to grapple with different perspectives and narratives. Literature classes could delve into the ethical dilemmas faced by characters, fostering empathy and understanding of complex human motivations. Even physical education could introduce discussions on sportsmanship, teamwork, and the ethics of competition.      Of course, it's not enough to just pose the questions. We need to equip students with the thinking tools to tackle these ethical dilemmas. This could involve introducing them to different ethical frameworks (like utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics), encouraging them to consider various perspectives, and fostering a culture of respectful debate and dialogue in the classroom. The goal is not to provide easy answers, but to cultivate a habit of mindful deliberation about the moral choices that technology, science, mathematics, and the very act of learning inevitably raise.      Developing skills for discernment      Some might argue that incorporating ethics into already packed curricula is unrealistic. However, I believe that ethical considerations can be woven seamlessly into existing lessons without sacrificing essential content knowledge. Moreover, by fostering critical thinking and ethical awareness, we're ultimately preparing students for success in all areas of life, not just their careers.      Others might worry that discussions of ethics will become overly subjective or lead to indoctrination. This concern is valid, but it highlights the importance of teacher training and careful lesson planning. By grounding ethical discussions in well-established frameworks, fostering respectful dialogue, and emphasizing the importance of reasoned argumentation, we can create a learning environment that encourages thoughtful reflection without imposing a single viewpoint.      By weaving ethics seamlessly into existing curricula, we make it an integral part of the learning process, rather than an abstract add-on. This approach can help students develop a sense of ethical responsibility alongside technical proficiency, empowering them to become critical thinkers and engaged citizens.      Certainly, there are potential challenges. Teachers will need the resources and training, and there's a risk of politicization. Careful planning, thoughtful facilitation, and a focus on civil discourse will be crucial.      Ultimately, this change will constitute a paradigm shift - one that is crucial if we are to save ourselves from the growing injustices of the world we live in. Education should not be just about preparing students for the workforce, but for life itself. By making ethical reflection a cornerstone of our educational system, we foster a generation capable not only of doing things well, but of doing the right thing.  - Rappler.com         Raimiel Dionido has years of experience in the development sector and a strong passion for quality education.

<p>WASHINGTON, DC, USA – US and British officials on Monday, March 25, filed charges, imposed sanctions, and accused Beijing of a sweeping cyberespionage campaign that allegedly hit millions of people including lawmakers, academics and journalists, and companies including defense contractors.</p>



<p>Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic nicknamed the hacking group Advanced Persistent Threat 31 or &#8220;APT31&#8221;, calling it an arm of China&#8217;s Ministry of State Security. Officials reeled off a laundry list of targets: White House staffers, US senators, British parliamentarians, and government officials across the world who criticized Beijing.</p>



<p>Few other victims were identified by name, but American officials said that the hackers&#8217; decade-plus spying spree compromised defense contractors, dissidents, and a variety of US companies, including American steel, energy, and apparel firms. Among the targets were leading providers of 5G mobile telephone equipment and wireless technology. Even the spouses of senior US officials and lawmakers were targeted, the officials said.</p>



<p>The aim of the global hacking operation was to &#8220;repress critics of the Chinese regime, compromise government institutions, and steal trade secrets,&#8221; Deputy US Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.</p>



<p>In an indictment unsealed on Monday against seven of the alleged Chinese hackers, US prosecutors in court said the hacking resulted in the confirmed or potential compromise of work accounts, personal emails, online storage and telephone call records belonging to millions of Americans. Officials in London accused APT31 of hacking British lawmakers critical of China and said that a second group of Chinese spies was behind the hack of Britain&#8217;s electoral watchdog that separately compromised the data of millions more people in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>Chinese diplomats in Britain and the US dismissed the allegations as unwarranted. The Chinese Embassy in London called the charges &#8220;completely fabricated and malicious slanders.&#8221;</p>



<p>Reuters was not immediately able to locate contact information for the seven alleged hackers being charged by the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>The announcements were made as both Britain and the US imposed sanctions on a firm they said was a Ministry of State Security front company tied to the hacking activity.</p>



<p>The US Treasury Department in a statement said the sanctions were on Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology, as well as on two Chinese nationals.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement exposes China&#8217;s continuous and brash efforts to undermine our nation&#8217;s cybersecurity and target Americans and our innovation,&#8221; FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.</p>



<p>Tensions over issues relating to cyberespionage have been rising between Beijing and Washington, as Western intelligence agencies have increasingly sounded the alarm on alleged Chinese state-backed hacking activity.</p>



<p>China has also begun in recent years to call out alleged Western hacking operations. For example, last year, the Ministry of State of Security claimed that the US National Security Agency had repeatedly penetrated Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei Technologies.</p>



<p>US prosecutors listed numerous unnamed victims around the globe who had been targeted, but several stand out in the indictment.</p>



<p>In 2020, the Chinese hackers targeted staffers working for a US presidential campaign, prosecutors wrote. The disclosure matches public reporting at the time by Google that Chinese hackers sent malicious emails to the campaign of current President Joe Biden, but no compromise had been detected.</p>

2628466,view-from-manila-ayungin-shoal-incident-united-states-japan-trilateral-indian-foreign-minister-visit,"View from Manila: &#8216;Tama na, Lord&#8217;  ","
<p>MANILA, Philippines – When the Unaizah May 4 approached Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea for a second time in a month, it was greeted by a familiar and violent foe: water cannons from the China Coast Guard (CCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Saturday, March 23, out at sea, the wooden ship held on, but barely. </p>



<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/Joseph_Morong/status/1772218052828188897"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">GMA News&#8217; exclusive video</a> taken from inside the Unaizah May 4 showed military personnel scrambling around an already-drenched ship deck as China&#8217;s water cannon imposed its way from one side of the ship to the other. </p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Tama na, Lord</em> (Lord, please stop this),&#8221; said one of the people in the video, before another blast of water shot through the ship. </p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/china-water-cannon-ayungin-shoal-march-23-2024/"">water cannons from the CCG </a>went on for over an hour (according to videos from the Armed Forces of the Philippines). The Unaizah May 4 suffered “severe damage” while Navy personnel on board also reported injuries.&nbsp;The video taken from inside the ship would suggest it&#8217;s a miracle that nobody got seriously hurt. </p>



<p>China reasoned out its use of water cannons, dangerous maneuvers, and blocking to push away the much-smaller Unaizah May 4 and Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessels. It said its CCG and Chinese Maritime Military “firmly [obstructed] the Philippines’ vessels, and [foiled] the Philippines’ attempt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manila called China out for what those actions actually were: “Illegal and irresponsible actions belies its hollow claims to peace, dialogue, and adherence to international law.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Año was a lot less diplomatic in his words for Beijing. </p>



<p>“Their actions are illegal, coercive, aggressive and even deceptive. This is just an ordinary rotation and resupply or provision operation but look at how the Chinese are reacting, it’s as if it’s already the end of the world. So it’s really humiliating themselves in front of the world,” he told the media in an interview on Sunday, March 24.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We will continue to do this, we will not be deterred, we will not be intimidated because it is our right and we have to protect our soldiers, our sailors there at BRP Sierra Madre,” said Año, a day before he met with Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin and other National Security Agency heads on what to recommend to the President.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have seen the CCG chase or chase away Philippine ships in Ayungin Shoal before. </p>



<p>The Unaizah May 4’s sister ships, the Unaizah May 1 and Uniazah May 2, as well as the M/L Kalayaan, bare battlescars from those missions – dents and damage from collisions, allisions, and the CCG’s water cannons. All three ships are still being repaired.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the intensity of the CCG’s actions on March 23, shown through video released by both the PCG and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in near-real time, was difficult to watch.&nbsp;But if you still want to, the clip is right here: </p>

<p>At one point, a CCG ship sailed backwards at what looked like high-speed, in an attempt to block the Unaizah May 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, harassment began even before daybreak – CCG and CMM ships “worked in tandem” against the PCG vessels and the Unaizah May 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), freshly incensed over a Chinese official in Manila’s disclosure of confidential discussions, made three protests over the March 23 Ayungin incident – a summon in Manila, a protest in Beijing, and a phone call from Undersecretary Ma. Theresa P. Lazaro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mission, which happens at least once a month, is meant to bring soldiers and supplies to the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal, an area just over 100 nautical miles off the coast of Palawan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The World War II-era vessel, purposefully run aground in 1999, now serves as a symbol of both the Philippines’ ingenuity and resilience, but also its military and material shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>The Manila-DC-Tokyo threesome&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>The latest dangerous incident in Ayungin Shoal happened just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to Manila and the White House’s announcement that it would be hosting in April the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/trilateral-summit-marcos-biden-kishida-white-house-april-2024/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">first-ever US-Japan-Philippines leaders summit</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US, a treaty-ally of the Philippines, said China’s actions are “destabilizing to the region and show clear disregard for international law.” Japan, through its embassy in Manila, reiterated its “grave concern on the repeated dangerous actions by CCG in SCS which resulted in Filipino injuries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Repeated violations of international law and the rights of the Philippines – water cannons, blocking maneuvers, close shadowing, other dangerous operations – these waterways are critical to the Philippines, to its security, to its economy, but they’re also critical to the interests of the region, the United States, and the world,” said Blinken on March 19, as he reaffirmed that the Mutual Defense Treaty would extend to armed attacks, including against the PCG, in the South China Sea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just two days after Blinken’s visit to Manila, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Okano Masataka hosted Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and the Philippines’ Undersecretary Lazaro in Tokyo to “deepen trilateral cooperation among the United States, Japan, and the Philippines.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Deputy Secretary Campbell, Vice Foreign Minister Okano, and Undersecretary Lazaro reiterated their collective commitment to maintaining peace and security in the Indo-Pacific, including in the South China Sea and East China Sea,” the State Department said in a readout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All eyes are on the burgeoning relationship among the three countries – a mix that would probably make the heads of Filipinos who survived the Japanese and American occupation&#8217;s spin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is a relationship that makes sense, especially as tensions in the West Philippine Sea and unease over the situation in Taiwan rise. Both Manila and Tokyo are treaty allies of the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Japan has had robust defense, trade, and aid ties with the Philippines, a relationship cultivated through decades and across administrations. A Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), a Visiting Forces Agreement-like deal that would govern how Japanese troops can engage in the Philippines, was hoped to be signed before the end of March 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Washington has been quick to respond to the Marcos administration’s openness to amping up ties with one of its oldest ally. Manalo said bilateral ties are on “hyperdrive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blinken said in response: “The alliance has never been stronger, but we not only have to sustain that, we have to continue to accelerate the momentum.”</p>



<p>And Beijing? Well, they’re certainly not enthused, as expected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The military cooperation between the US and the Philippines should not undermine China’s sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used to support the illegal claims of the Philippines,” said the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson Lin Jian, responding to Blinken’s concerns over Chinese actions in the South China Sea.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-another-threesome-in-the-making""><strong>Another threesome in the making?&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>The Marcos administration has been on hyperdrive in improving its bilateral and multilateral ties, especially in terms of security and defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lazaro, in a chance interview in early March, said there would be “no difficulties” in another trilateral relationship: between the Philippines, Japan, and India. Although no formal talks have started, Philippine-Japan ties have always been robust. Manila and New Delhi ties have only improved in recent years. </p>



<p>From March 25 to 27, Manila will be hosting Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. This would be their top diplomat’s second visit to the Philippines in just over two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In addition to advancing trade and tourism between two of Asia’s fastest growing economies, the foreign minister’s meeting with Secretary for Foreign Affairs Enrique A. Manalo will focus on defense and maritime cooperation, food security, development, healthcare and financial technology cooperation,” said the DFA in a release.</p>

<p>Manila is Jaishankar’s last stop in a three-country tour around the region. Indian Ambassador to Manila Shambhu S. Kumaran, speaking at the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation 2024 Day, said bilateral ties between Manila and New Delhi were at their “best ever.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a timely visit from New Delhi – India, too, has to contend with China’s encroachment. In August 2023, it protested China’s new “standard map,” which claimed parts of Indian territory.&nbsp;The Philippines has long protested China&#8217;s version of reality – in particular, because in that map, almost all of the South China Sea is Beijing&#8217;s. </p>

GMA News' exclusive video  taken from inside the Unaizah May 4 showed military personnel scrambling around an already-drenched ship deck as China's water cannon imposed its way from one side of the ship to the other.       "" Tama na, Lord  (Lord, please stop this),"" said one of the people in the video, before another blast of water shot through the ship.       The  water cannons from the CCG  went on for over an hour (according to videos from the Armed Forces of the Philippines). The Unaizah May 4 suffered ""severe damage"" while Navy personnel on board also reported injuries. The video taken from inside the ship would suggest it's a miracle that nobody got seriously hurt.       China reasoned out its use of water cannons, dangerous maneuvers, and blocking to push away the much-smaller Unaizah May 4 and Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessels. It said its CCG and Chinese Maritime Military ""firmly [obstructed] the Philippines' vessels, and [foiled] the Philippines' attempt.""       Manila called China out for what those actions actually were: ""Illegal and irresponsible actions belies its hollow claims to peace, dialogue, and adherence to international law.""       The Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano was a lot less diplomatic in his words for Beijing.       ""Their actions are illegal, coercive, aggressive and even deceptive. This is just an ordinary rotation and resupply or provision operation but look at how the Chinese are reacting, it's as if it's already the end of the world. So it's really humiliating themselves in front of the world,"" he told the media in an interview on Sunday, March 24.                    Play  Video                     ""We will continue to do this, we will not be deterred, we will not be intimidated because it is our right and we have to protect our soldiers, our sailors there at BRP Sierra Madre,"" said Ano, a day before he met with Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin and other National Security Agency heads on what to recommend to the President.        We have seen the CCG chase or chase away Philippine ships in Ayungin Shoal before.       The Unaizah May 4's sister ships, the Unaizah May 1 and Uniazah May 2, as well as the M/L Kalayaan, bare battlescars from those missions - dents and damage from collisions, allisions, and the CCG's water cannons. All three ships are still being repaired.       But the intensity of the CCG's actions on March 23, shown through video released by both the PCG and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in near-real time, was difficult to watch. But if you still want to, the clip is right here:                    Play  Video                     At one point, a CCG ship sailed backwards at what looked like high-speed, in an attempt to block the Unaizah May 4.       According to the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, harassment began even before daybreak - CCG and CMM ships ""worked in tandem"" against the PCG vessels and the Unaizah May 4.       The Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), freshly incensed over a Chinese official in Manila's disclosure of confidential discussions, made three protests over the March 23 Ayungin incident - a summon in Manila, a protest in Beijing, and a phone call from Undersecretary Ma. Theresa P. Lazaro.       The mission, which happens at least once a month, is meant to bring soldiers and supplies to the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal, an area just over 100 nautical miles off the coast of Palawan.       The World War II-era vessel, purposefully run aground in 1999, now serves as a symbol of both the Philippines' ingenuity and resilience, but also its military and material shortcomings.        The Manila-DC-Tokyo threesome        The latest dangerous incident in Ayungin Shoal happened just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Manila and the White House's announcement that it would be hosting in April the  first-ever US-Japan-Philippines leaders summit .       The US, a treaty-ally of the Philippines, said China's actions are ""destabilizing to the region and show clear disregard for international law."" Japan, through its embassy in Manila, reiterated its ""grave concern on the repeated dangerous actions by CCG in SCS which resulted in Filipino injuries.""                        Must Read                          Foreign governments stand with Philippines after latest incident in Ayungin Shoal                                                                                         Blinken, in a joint presser with Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo, said the US has a ""shared concern about the PRC's actions that threaten our common vision for a free, open Indo-Pacific, including in the South China Sea and in the Philippines exclusive economic zone.""        FRIENDS. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits Manila on March 19, 2024.       ""Repeated violations of international law and the rights of the Philippines - water cannons, blocking maneuvers, close shadowing, other dangerous operations - these waterways are critical to the Philippines, to its security, to its economy, but they're also critical to the interests of the region, the United States, and the world,"" said Blinken on March 19, as he reaffirmed that the Mutual Defense Treaty would extend to armed attacks, including against the PCG, in the South China Sea.       Just two days after Blinken's visit to Manila, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Okano Masataka hosted Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and the Philippines' Undersecretary Lazaro in Tokyo to ""deepen trilateral cooperation among the United States, Japan, and the Philippines.""       ""Deputy Secretary Campbell, Vice Foreign Minister Okano, and Undersecretary Lazaro reiterated their collective commitment to maintaining peace and security in the Indo-Pacific, including in the South China Sea and East China Sea,"" the State Department said in a readout.       All eyes are on the burgeoning relationship among the three countries - a mix that would probably make the heads of Filipinos who survived the Japanese and American occupation's spin.       But it is a relationship that makes sense, especially as tensions in the West Philippine Sea and unease over the situation in Taiwan rise. Both Manila and Tokyo are treaty allies of the United States.       Japan has had robust defense, trade, and aid ties with the Philippines, a relationship cultivated through decades and across administrations. A Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), a Visiting Forces Agreement-like deal that would govern how Japanese troops can engage in the Philippines, was hoped to be signed before the end of March 2024.       Washington has been quick to respond to the Marcos administration's openness to amping up ties with one of its oldest ally. Manalo said bilateral ties are on ""hyperdrive.""       Blinken said in response: ""The alliance has never been stronger, but we not only have to sustain that, we have to continue to accelerate the momentum.""      And Beijing? Well, they're certainly not enthused, as expected.       ""The military cooperation between the US and the Philippines should not undermine China's sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used to support the illegal claims of the Philippines,"" said the Chinese Foreign Ministry's spokesperson Lin Jian, responding to Blinken's concerns over Chinese actions in the South China Sea.        Another threesome in the making?        The Marcos administration has been on hyperdrive in improving its bilateral and multilateral ties, especially in terms of security and defense.       Lazaro, in a chance interview in early March, said there would be ""no difficulties"" in another trilateral relationship: between the Philippines, Japan, and India. Although no formal talks have started, Philippine-Japan ties have always been robust. Manila and New Delhi ties have only improved in recent years.       From March 25 to 27, Manila will be hosting Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. This would be their top diplomat's second visit to the Philippines in just over two years.       ""In addition to advancing trade and tourism between two of Asia's fastest growing economies, the foreign minister's meeting with Secretary for Foreign Affairs Enrique A. Manalo will focus on defense and maritime cooperation, food security, development, healthcare and financial technology cooperation,"" said the DFA in a release.        WELCOME TO MANILA. The Samudra Paheredar makes a port call in Manila on March 25.        Manila is Jaishankar's last stop in a three-country tour around the region. Indian Ambassador to Manila Shambhu S. Kumaran, speaking at the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation 2024 Day, said bilateral ties between Manila and New Delhi were at their ""best ever.""        It's a timely visit from New Delhi - India, too, has to contend with China's encroachment. In August 2023, it protested China's new ""standard map,"" which claimed parts of Indian territory. The Philippines has long protested China's version of reality - in particular, because in that map, almost all of the South China Sea is Beijing's.       Cooperation between the coast guards of India and the Philippines are well and good. The two coast guards signed a memorandum of understanding for ""enhancing maritime cooperation"" back in August 2023.       The India Coast Guard's Samura Pahererar is docked in Manila to coincide with Minister Jaishankar's visit.  - Rappler.com    ",Neutral

2628421,de-la-salle-university-students-win-grant-cafeteria-food-waste-biogas-project,DLSU students win P1-million grant for cafeteria food waste to biogas project,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – Three students from De La Salle University Manila (DLSU) won a P1-million grant after topping a <a href=""https://firstgencodegreen.com/register"">competition</a> for innovative solutions to curb campus emissions, sponsored by Lopez-owned First Gen Corporation.</p>



<p>Engineering student Fernando Magallanes, organizational communication student Alexia Roman, and economics student Ralph Stephen Saavedra designed a compact anaerobic digester system that will convert cafeteria food waste to biogas.</p>



<p>Saavedra said their team was inspired by existing anaerobic digestion tanks used in large farms. &#8220;We tried to create a scaled-down version of it with numerous key modifications to make it indoor-compatible, safe, and reliable,&#8221; told Rappler in a message. </p>



<p>He said the team is also working on a variant of the design that can be used in hospitality establishments and restaurants. </p>



<p>The million-peso grant will be used to install digesters in three cafeterias of the Manila campus, as well as in the Laguna campus, according to Roman. Each student is also set to receive P100,000 individually.</p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FFirstGenPH%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0SDYS6HzqLgje7VpWKYBG8bNYQRvf4jN6T8Kkp7ntot6pZW98zKHiU16KQN7yKYjPl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""250"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>Every year, DLSU’s cafeterias produce over 28,000 kilograms of kitchen waste, and are responsible for 480,000 kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a release from First Gen.</p>



<p>The technology is both an economic and environmental solution, as waste increases over time, and poor waste management causes pollution and contaminates the environment. Food loss and waste <a href=""https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-you-need-know-about-combatting-food-loss-and-waste"">account</a> for 8% to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to research by the lntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>



<p>&#8220;The technology to utilize organic waste as a source of flammable cooking fuel, electricity, and  compost already exists, but is yet to be thoroughly explored and implemented here in the Philippines,&#8221; said Saavedra. </p>



<p>Through anaerobic digestion, bacteria breaks down organic matter like food waste to produce biogas, a type of renewable fuel.</p>

Engineering student Fernando Magallanes, organizational communication student Alexia Roman, and economics student Ralph Stephen Saavedra designed a compact anaerobic digester system that will convert cafeteria food waste to biogas.      Saavedra said their team was inspired by existing anaerobic digestion tanks used in large farms. ""We tried to create a scaled-down version of it with numerous key modifications to make it indoor-compatible, safe, and reliable,"" told Rappler in a message.       He said the team is also working on a variant of the design that can be used in hospitality establishments and restaurants.       The million-peso grant will be used to install digesters in three cafeterias of the Manila campus, as well as in the Laguna campus, according to Roman. Each student is also set to receive P100,000 individually.              Every year, DLSU's cafeterias produce over 28,000 kilograms of kitchen waste, and are responsible for 480,000 kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a release from First Gen.      The technology is both an economic and environmental solution, as waste increases over time, and poor waste management causes pollution and contaminates the environment. Food loss and waste  account  for 8% to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to research by the lntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.      ""The technology to utilize organic waste as a source of flammable cooking fuel, electricity, and  compost already exists, but is yet to be thoroughly explored and implemented here in the Philippines,"" said Saavedra.       Through anaerobic digestion, bacteria breaks down organic matter like food waste to produce biogas, a type of renewable fuel.      Over 50 teams from 29 universities and colleges across the Philippines joined the competition launched in February 2024.

Or are you, like most of us mortals in the newsroom, tied to your laptop and to the labors that must be done even in the Catholic world’s supposedly quietest week?</p>



<p>“No rest for the wicked” has taken on its biblical and worldly meaning in the last few days. In Timor-Leste, a Filipino fugitive,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/things-to-know-arnie-teves-negros-oriental-third-district-representative/"">expelled congressman Arnie Teves</a>, has finally been&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/arnie-teves-arrested-timor-leste-march-21-2024/"">arrested</a>.

<p>China is annoyed, though. Two weeks ago, its defense spokesperson again blasted the Philippines and urged it “not to further walk down the wrong path.”&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>This came days after an unnamed Chinese official disclosed to a friendly newspaper,&nbsp;<em>The Manila Times</em>, details of a supposed understanding between Beijing and former president Rodrigo Duterte to “normalize” the situation in the South China Sea.

2628119,angeles-toddlers-death-inside-car-prompts-probe-into-parental-accountability,Angeles toddlers&#8217; death inside car prompts probe into parental accountability,"
<p>ANGELES, Philippines – Authorities are looking into the accountability of the parents of two unattended toddlers who tragically suffocated inside a car in Angeles City. The city’s mayor also directed the local social welfare and development office to reassess regulations pertaining to children&#8217;s protection and welfare to prevent such tragedies from occurring again in Angeles City.</p>



<p>The two toddlers, both cousins, were playing beside a parked car on Cuayan Street in Barangay Malabanias, Angeles City, on Friday morning, March 22. It was the last time anyone saw the little boys alive.</p>



<p>Four hours later, the two boys – a three-year-old and a two-year-old – were found dead inside a sun-baked maroon Toyota Vios, with plate number CBE 3794, according to the Angeles City Police Office (ACPO).</p>



<p>The two toddlers, police theorized, managed to enter the car but were unable to get out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – Residents of Davao City had already witnessed rampant bloodshed even before Mayor Sebastian “Baste” Duterte, son of the former president, declared on March 22, his war against illegal drugs. His new declaration could make the violence even worse. </p>



<p>There have been at least 97 drug-related killings in Davao City between July 1, 2022 and March 15, 2024, according to monitoring conducted by the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/dahas-project-count-drug-war-deaths-bongbong-marcos-jr-rodrigo-duterte/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Dahas Project</a> of the University of the Philippines’ Third World Studies Center. This means that at least one person was killed a week since Baste Duterte took office. </p>



<p>Out of this number, 96 were killed by state agents – from the Philippine National Police or the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. One was killed by an unidentified assailant. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/dahas-project-count-drug-war-deaths-bongbong-marcos-jr-rodrigo-duterte/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Dahas Project</a> is the only remaining effort to methodologically count the drug-related killings across the Philippines that continued from Duterte to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.</p>



<p>The latest death toll in Davao City accounts for at least 16% of the 582 drug-related killings recorded under the current Marcos administration as of <a href=""https://twitter.com/DahasPH/status/1769668088222437768"">March 15</a>. </p>



<p>In a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/13H8QtAeSU5rs79zFg7pURlht3WwwRqQX/view"">report</a> released to mark the first year of the Marcos administration, the team noted the “sudden emergence of Davao del Sur as the top hotspot” for drug-related killings. The primary victims are “low-level drug peddlers&#8221; and mostly concentrated in Davao City.</p>



<p>During Baste&#8217;s first 12 months in office, at least 53 people were already killed in Davao City alone – almost 15% of the total <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/death-toll-drug-war-marcos-jr-first-year-office-dahas-project-2023/"">342 drug-related killings</a> during the first year of the Marcos administration.</p>

<p>The younger Duterte on March 22 echoed the messaging of his father, warning alleged drug personalities to leave before he gets to them. </p>



<p>&#8220;So this will be your chance to get out of this city. If not, sorry, I’m already telling you right now, get out of here [and] if you’re not going to stop, I’ll kill you,&#8221; he said in Bisaya during the ceremony welcoming new Davao City police chief Richard Bad-ang.</p>



<p>Between then and Monday, March 25, the Facebook page of Davao City already posted about two individuals killed in police anti-illegal drug operations. This could just be the beginning of rampant violence, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) senior researcher Carlos Conde. </p>



<p>“With Mayor Duterte’s declaration of war against drugs in his city, we fear the violence will worsen and the impunity will persist,” he told Rappler on Monday.</p>



<p>“We also cannot expect accountability for the killings, what with the Duterte family’s tight grip on the city,&#8221; Conde added. </p>

<p>The violence that continues in Davao City is a legacy of the Duterte patriarch who served as mayor for more than two decades. His rule was marked by killings –&nbsp;estimated to be in the thousands –&nbsp;allegedly carried out by the notorious Davao Death Squad (DDS).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The elder Duterte spread the bloodshed nationwide after he became president in 2016. He ended his term in June 2022 with his flagship anti-illegal drug campaign killing at least 6,252 in police operations alone, according to official numbers. If those killed vigilante-style are included, human rights groups estimate, the numbers would rise to between 27,000 and 30,000.</p>



<p>His violent war on drugs is currently under investigation at the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity.

In June 2022, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/inaction-davao-death-squad-part-push-resume-international-criminal-court-probe/"">said</a> that “the Government of the Philippines has provided no information whatsoever about past or ongoing criminal investigations or prosecutions relating to alleged crimes committed in Davao.”&nbsp;</p>

2628092,opinion-challenge-to-marcos-government-and-milf-bangsamoro,[OPINION] A challenge to Marcos government and MILF,"
<p>On the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the signing of the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/14186-gov-t-milf-sign-historic-peace-plan/"">Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro </a>(CAB), there are reasons to celebrate. </p>



<p>First, the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/topic/bangsamoro-autonomous-region-muslim-mindanao/"">Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao</a> (BARMM) has been established pursuant to its Organic Law and the regional legislations that provide for the mechanisms and the policies for its operations are in place. </p>



<p>Second, the intergovernmental relations mechanisms to coordinate and resolve policy disputes between Manila and the BARMM government are operational.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, fiscal autonomy of BARMM, with the block grant, has been at its highest level since the establishment of regional autonomy in 1977.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fourth, the first regional <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/mindanao-journalists-gear-up-barmm-elections/"">parliamentary elections </a>are on track to be held in May 2025 with no less than 23 political groups/parties monitored to be preparing to be registered and accredited in order that they can field candidates in the regional elections. The May 2025 elections is the conclusion of the political transition as it finally establishes the regional Parliamentary government. </p>



<p>There are two critical developments that highlight the difficult challenges in the implementation of the political track of the CAB. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-legal-challenges"">Legal challenges</h5>



<p>The first is the petition in the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code (BEC) and the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code (BLGC) as well as the petition of the Province of Sulu questioning the constitutionality of the Parliamentary system in the BARMM which remains pending in the Supreme Court to date. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The second critical development is the approval of BTA Resolution no. 521, which expresses the sense of the BARMM Parliament, to support <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-hearing-bangsamoro-perspective-charter-change/"">charter change to resolve constitutional Issues</a> in the implementation of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro. </p>



<p>The three pending petitions in the Supreme Court raise the same basic legal argument that BARMM’s autonomy is located within the Philippine unitary system of government and regional laws must always be consistent with the Constitution and national laws. Thus, regional laws are valid only insofar as they do not violate the Constitution, the BOL and other national laws.  </p>

<p>BTA Resolution no, 521 is calling for amending the Constitution to fully implement the terms of the CAB on power sharing – the exclusive, reserve and concurrent powers of BARMM and the national government; the Shariah Justice system; policing; supervision and control of the regional government over its local government units; delineation of powers of the Constitutional bodies relative to the regional government and qualification of the Chief Minister.</p>



<p>The petitions in the Supreme Court and BTA resolution no. 521 are challenging the view that the Philippine Constitution has flexibilities to accommodate the terms of the CAB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “Constitution as flexible” argument has in fact long been debunked in the legislation of the BOL. The heart of any autonomy arrangement is clear delineation of powers between the center and the autonomous territory. In the legislation of the BOL, Congress has found that vesting the BARMM with exclusive powers is inconsistent with the Constitution, thus the classification of powers in the CAB – exclusive powers for the BARMM, reserve powers for the national government and concurrent powers for both national and regional government, was not adopted in the BOL.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-exit-agreement"">Exit agreement</h5>



<p>With BTA Resolution 521, charter amendments in so far as the MILF-led BTA is concerned, is necessary nonetheless, whichever way the Supreme Court decides on these cases.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>If charter change is required for the CAB to be fully implemented, what is the prospect for the government and the MILF signing an exit agreement before the regional elections in May 2025?</p>



<p>There is high expectations for signing an exit agreement but we need to reexamine what exit agreement means in relation to the political track of the CAB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CAB as a negotiated political agreement is not self-executing and must be translated into a law to be enforceable.That law is the Bangsamoro Organic Law which was approved in a plebiscite. The President, under our system of separation of powers, cannot bind Congress and the judiciary on the terms of the CAB. In particular, the President, as ruled by the Supreme Court in the MOA-AD case, cannot bind the other branches of government in changing the constitution. Congress, on the other hand, must insure that the BOL is legislated in line with the Constitution. </p>



<p>In this context, how could the parties conclude an agreement to move the peace process forward while at the same time keeping in play the agreed political components of the CAB?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here lies the resilience of the CAB and the foresight and innovative thinking of the GPH and MILF negotiators. The CAB provides that the Transition Commission shall work on proposals to amend the Philippine Constitution for the purpose of accommodating and entrenching in the Constitution the agreement of the parties whenever necessary without derogating from any prior peace agreement.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-role-of-transition-commission"">Role of Transition Commission</h5>



<p>By this provision, the GPH and the MILF agreed on a process in the event the terms of the political components of the CAB cannot be implemented because of constitutional constraints. As early as the second Bangsamoro Transition Commission, proposals to amend the Constitution to implement the terms of the CAB were submitted by the BTC to the Office of then President Duterte. BTA resolution 521 demonstrates the resolve of the MILF-led regional government in pushing for charter amendments to implement the CAB. </p>



<p>The CAB provides for the avenue for charter change to be proposed by the Transition Commission when needed. But the GPH is not obligated to undertake charter change because the Transition Commission can only propose but the President cannot guarantee charter change.&nbsp; On the other hand, the MILF can raise the unfulfilled terms of the CAB due to constitutional constraints as basis for not signing an exit agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then-president Duterte understood how the implementation of the CAB is constrained by the Constitution that in his inaugural address he has committed to implement all signed peace agreements with the Moro fronts but with the qualification “in step with legal and constitutional reforms”.</p>



<p>It is important to understand the dynamics of CAB, the BOL and the Philippine Constitution in relation to the exit agreement. By understanding these dynamics and the spirit of the CAB, the exit agreement with respect to the political track can be framed constructively. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-test-for-government-milf"">Test for government, MILF</h5>



<p>First, political institutions and public policies evolve. Just as peace is a process not a goal, state or institution building is incremental alongside the development of institutional capacities and structures, clarifying intergovernmental relations in multilevel government and strengthening public policies. </p>



<p>There are no quick fixes in building accountable and efficient institutions and public policies. Since it is a process not an end, state-building is not terminable. An exit agreement, I respectfully submit, is anathema to the evolving and incremental process of state and institution building.</p>



<p>Second, state-building is not a two-party affair but a democratic process that requires participation of all citizens.&nbsp; Just as the executive branch of the Philippine government cannot bind Congress and the voting citizens of the Philippines who will have to approve charter amendments in a plebiscite, the MILF that negotiated the CAB may not compromise the implementation of the political components of the CAB which have already gained constituents in Moro society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, exit agreement in relation to the political track, means that the MILF has exited and abandoned the battlefield and have entered the democratic and parliamentary space as the arena for pushing their vision and aspirations for the Bangsamoro. An exit agreement is not applicable to the implementation of the political components of the CAB that are not self-executing but requires a political process to fulfill them. </p>



<p>In conclusion, with respect to the political track of the peace process, the success or failure of its implementation does not solely rest on the signing or non-signing of an exit agreement. The ultimate test is whether the GPH has demonstrated openness to consider the proposals for charter change to accommodate the terms of the CAB. And on the part of the MILF, whether it has effectively abandoned the armed struggle and has embraced the democratic and parliamentary space as the arena for pushing its ideals and aspirations. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

First, the  Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao  (BARMM) has been established pursuant to its Organic Law and the regional legislations that provide for the mechanisms and the policies for its operations are in place.       Second, the intergovernmental relations mechanisms to coordinate and resolve policy disputes between Manila and the BARMM government are operational.       Third, fiscal autonomy of BARMM, with the block grant, has been at its highest level since the establishment of regional autonomy in 1977.       Fourth, the first regional  parliamentary elections  are on track to be held in May 2025 with no less than 23 political groups/parties monitored to be preparing to be registered and accredited in order that they can field candidates in the regional elections. The May 2025 elections is the conclusion of the political transition as it finally establishes the regional Parliamentary government.       There are two critical developments that highlight the difficult challenges in the implementation of the political track of the CAB.       Legal challenges      The first is the petition in the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Bangsamoro Electoral Code (BEC) and the Bangsamoro Local Governance Code (BLGC) as well as the petition of the Province of Sulu questioning the constitutionality of the Parliamentary system in the BARMM which remains pending in the Supreme Court to date.        The second critical development is the approval of BTA Resolution no. 521, which expresses the sense of the BARMM Parliament, to support  charter change to resolve constitutional Issues  in the implementation of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro.       The three pending petitions in the Supreme Court raise the same basic legal argument that BARMM's autonomy is located within the Philippine unitary system of government and regional laws must always be consistent with the Constitution and national laws. Thus, regional laws are valid only insofar as they do not violate the Constitution, the BOL and other national laws.

<p>CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Authorities confirmed on Monday, March 25, the death of one of the leaders of a faction of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighter (BIFF), barely a week after <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/biff-warns-more-attacks-maguindanao-del-sur-march-18-2024/"">the radical group threatened to launch more attacks</a> against the military and police, even during the Ramadan period, in response to government offensives in Maguindanao del Sur.</p>



<p>Brigadier General Jose Vlademir Cagara, commander of the Army’s 1st Brigade, said government troops killed BIFF-Karialan faction leader Abu Halil during a fierce encounter in Maguindanao del Sur last Friday, March 22.</p>



<p>Halil, who served as the training officer of the BIFF faction, is the brother of Khadaf Abdulatif, the group’s chief of staff.</p>



<p>In 2008, the BIFF emerged as a splinter group from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao. Following <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/89833-biff-founder-kato-dead/"">the demise of its leader, Ameril Umra Kato, in 2015</a>, the organization fragmented into multiple factions, among them Halil’s group.</p>



<p>Cagara said the fierce clash between the soldiers and Halil’s group lasted for 30 minutes in Sitio Binakuyan, Barangay Salbu in Datu Saudi Ampatuan town.</p>



<p>When the armed group retreated, the soldiers searched the encounter site and found the body of Halil, with an M16 rifle with four magazines on his side.</p>



<p>The clash took place approximately 18 kilometers from Datu Hoffer Ampatuan town, where BIFF members killed four soldiers last March 17.</p>



<p>The military said the Karialan faction was not aligned with the Dawlah Islamiya terror organization until it joined forces with a more radical BIFF group – the Bungos faction – in carrying out the March 17 ambush that killed soldiers from the Army’s 40th Infantry Battalion. The soldiers killed were identified as Privates Marvin Dumaging and Jessie James Corpuz, Private 1st Class Carl Araña, and Corporal Creszaldy Espartero.</p>



<p>On March 18, the group warned that it would launch more attacks against government forces as it claimed responsibility for the ambush that occurred a day earlier.</p>



<p>The BIFF claimed responsibility for the raid on March 16, targeting a military patrol base in Pagatin, located in Datu Salibo town. During the exchange of gunfire, two soldiers were injured.</p>



<p>Abu Sapyun, spokesperson for the BIFF-Karialan faction, said the recent assaults on the military were in response to ongoing military offensives, such as a raid in Sitio Tatapan, Kitango village in Datu Saudi Ampatuan town, Maguindanao del Sur. The military raid resulted in the death of Abdul Kader Animbang, a sibling of BIFF leader Kagi Karialan, and nephew Hamidi Animbang. –<strong> Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>MOSCOW, Russia – Russia on Monday, March 25, cast doubt on assertions by the United States that the Islamic State militant group was responsible for a gun attack on a concert hall outside Moscow which killed 137 people and injured 182 more.</p>



<p>In the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/russia-concert-terror-attack-updates-march-23-2024/"">deadliest attack inside Russia</a> for two decades, four men burst into the Crocus City Hall on Friday night, spraying people with bullets just before Soviet-era rock group Picnic was to perform its hit &#8220;Afraid of Nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Four men, at least one a Tajik, were remanded in custody for terrorism. They appeared separately, led into a cage at Moscow&#8217;s Basmanny district court by Federal Security Service officers.</p>



<p>Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, a claim which the United States has publicly said it believed, and the militant group has since released what it says is footage from the attack. U.S. officials said they warned Russia of intelligence about an imminent attack earlier this month.</p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – With the future of the Pasig River Expressway (PAREX) project <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/ramon-ang-says-pasig-river-expressway-not-pushing-through/"">uncertain</a>, advocates who opposed the project called on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to center his Pasig River revival initiative on the needs of communities near the iconic waterway.</p>



<p>Joven Jacolbia and Rigel Magcale, members of volunteer group Ilog Pasiglahin, told Rappler on Friday, March 22, that they would support the President&#8217;s and First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos&#8217; &#8220;Pasig Bigyang Buhay Muli Project&#8221; (PBBM), if it would be based on genuine consultation with communities.</p>



<p>&#8220;We welcome the plan because we in Ilog Pasiglahin think that government should take the lead in rehabilitating Pasig River,&#8221; said Jacolbia in a <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/moveph/be-the-good-show-parex-and-reimagining-pasig-river/""><em>Be The Good</em> interview</a> with Rappler community lead Pia Ranada. </p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the plans. President Marcos said, it will be people-driven, community-oriented, but right now, unfortunately, none of us–and even none of our partner communities–have been consulted in the drafting or planning the program,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Pasig Bigyang Buhay Muli Project,&#8221; which has the same acronym as Marcos&#8217; name, was officially introduced to the public last January. It has its roots in his July 2023 executive order which created the&nbsp;Inter-Agency Council for the Pasig River Urban Development (IAC-PRUD), headed by the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development and vice-chaired by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority.</p>

<p>Jacolbia and Magcale, however, emphasized that genuine public consultation and collaboration with Pasig River communities would make the Marcos plan more sustainable.

<p>He also pointed out that, in the local development plans of cities that would be traversed by PAREX, the river&#8217;s banks were identified mostly as recreational or tourist sites, not as a site for a major road.

<ul>
<li>Local communities and their livelihood: A project can only be fully realized if the government understands what the people need.</li>



<li>Environment: The rehabilitation of the Pasig River should not only center on a clean-up drive for the water system, but also ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem where animals, particularly fish and birds, can thrive.</li>



<li>Transportation: There should be clear, concrete plans on how the waterway and its banks can be utilized for transportation. Access to bike lanes and ferry services must be open and expanded to all communities.</li>



<li>Heritage and tourism: These two interconnected components point to the prominence of the Pasig River both as a heritage and tourist site. Proper utilization and promotion of historical structures built near the rivers such as the Intramuros and Fort Santiago situated inside it help revive interest in landmarks.</li>



<li>Urban planning: The Pasig River stands at the heart of the busy metropolis, stringing together cities and bodies of water, including Laguna de Bay and Manila Bay. With strategic urban planning, Pasig River could better contribute to improves access, mobility, and connections throughout the metropolis.</li>

Joven Jacolbia and Rigel Magcale, members of volunteer group Ilog Pasiglahin, told Rappler on Friday, March 22, that they would support the President's and First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos' ""Pasig Bigyang Buhay Muli Project"" (PBBM), if it would be based on genuine consultation with communities.      ""We welcome the plan because we in Ilog Pasiglahin think that government should take the lead in rehabilitating Pasig River,"" said Jacolbia in a   Be The Good  interview  with Rappler community lead Pia Ranada.       ""We've seen the plans.

The ""Pasig Bigyang Buhay Muli Project,"" which has the same acronym as Marcos' name, was officially introduced to the public last January.

2628132,pro-environment-group-calls-demolition-viral-resort-chocolate-hills,Pro-environment group calls for demolition of viral Chocolate Hills resort,"
<p>CEBU, Philippines – Advocates of the group Tagbilaran Baywatch in Bohol said that government resolutions that endorsed the construction of the controversial <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/filipinos-online-post-reactions-resort-built-near-chocolate-hills/"">Captain’s Peak Resort</a> violated environmental laws and thus should be revoked, and the structures of the erring facility demolished and removed.</p>



<p>In a position paper prepared by lawyer Esther Gertrude Biliran and Leah Wilfreda Chavez, Tagbilaran Baywatch called out the Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) for its resolutions which allowed the resort to develop within the area of the Chocolate Hills in Sagbayan town, Bohol.</p>



<p>The resolutions mentioned were PAMB Resolution No. 1, s. 2018 and PAMB Resolution No. 21, s. 2022.</p>



<p>Because these two resolutions &#8220;were issued in favor of Captain&#8217;s Peak&#8230; without any legal basis&#8221; and violated the Chocolate Hills Natural Monument status as a protected area, the environment advocacy group called for &#8220;permanent closure and removal&#8221; of all illegal structures at the Sagbayan area.</p>



<p>Tagbilaran Baywatch added: &#8220;We call on the DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources), PAMB, and/or Sagbayan LGU to initiate legal actions to cause the removal or transfer of the structures of the resort.&#8221; </p>



<p>Earlier, officials like Bohol 3rd District Representative Alexie Tutor also called for the demolition of the structures. In a statement on March 13, she said that the resort should not have been allowed to be built at the site in the first place. </p>



<p>“PAMB Resolution No. 1 invoked in the WHEREAS clause Presidential Proclamation No. 333 creating the protected area, and, at the same time, required that the function hall and all other infrastructure should be erected and/or constructed within the 20% area from the base of the hill which is considered as the multiple use zone,” said the statement of Tagbilaran Baywatch.</p>



<p>Under the <a href=""https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2003/02/26/proclamation-no-333-s-2003/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">proclamation</a>, the land within 20 meters from the baseline of every hill outward is considered part of the CHNM and serves as a drawback or buffer zone for <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/environment/things-to-know-chocolate-hills/#:~:text=Proclamation%20No.%20333%20excluded%20%E2%80%9Calienable,Protected%20System%20(NIPAS)%20Act."">the protected area</a>.</p>



<p>“The PAMB resolution, therefore, required Captain’s Peak Resort to construct its building and other infrastructure within the hill itself from the base of the hill upward to 20% thereof. This PAMB resolution grossly violated its invoked Presidential Proclamation No. 333,” the position paper read.</p>



<p>The environmentalists noted that the second resolution did not include again the no-build zone within the hill and the buffer zone 20 meters from the baseline of the hill outward.</p>



<p>“This 20-meter drawback/buffer zone from the baseline outward was recognized by Republic Act 11038 or the Expanded National Integrated Protected Areas System (E-NIPAS) Act of 2018,” the statement said.</p>



<p>Under section 22 of the E-NIPAS Act, all property and private rights within the protected area and its buffer zones already existing and/or vested upon the effectivity of this act are protected and respected in accordance with existing laws.</p>



<p>Tagbilaran Baywatch said that the PAMB should revoke the two resolutions. </p>



<p>“Tagbilaran Baywatch, therefore, supports the call of Senator Nancy Binay and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives to ask the DENR-PAMB to explain why it allowed Captain Peak’s Resort to use at least a 20 percent portion of the Chocolate Hills in its resolution,” they said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-demanding-accountability""><strong>Demanding accountability</strong></h5>



<p>In the same position paper, the Tagbilaran Baywatch also called for the termination and prosecution of <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/why-is-there-resort-built-chocolate-hills/"">negligent government officials</a> that allowed the construction of the resort.</p>



<p>On Thursday, March 21, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benhur Abalos said in a press conference that only a barangay captain served as the chairperson of PAMB when it issued PAMB Resolution No. 1, s. 2018.</p>



<p>In a video posted on the official&#8217;s Facebook page, Abalos can be quoted saying, “<em>Ang nag-chair ay isang barangay captain kaya naipasa itong tungkol sa Captain’s Peak</em> (The person who chaired was a barangay captain that’s why the Captain’s Peak resolution was passed).”</p>

<p>Through copies of the resolutions acquired by Rappler, it found out that Tito Ancog, a barangay captain of Canmano at the time, presided over the meeting for the PAMB Resolution No. 1, s. 2018 on <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/timeline-controversy-chocolate-hills-resort/"">February 15, 2018</a>.</p>



<p>However, the 2018 resolution was prepared by PAMB Secretariat Lorna Fernandez, attested by City Environment and Natural Resources officer Laurentino Bautista, and concurred by then-Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Central Visayas Regional Executive Director Gilbert Gonzales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second meeting for the 2022 resolution was also presided by Ancog. The resolution was still prepared by Fernandez but was now reviewed by Provincial Environment and Natural Resources officer Ariel Rica.</p>



<p>DENR Central Visayas Regional Executive Director Paquito D. Melicor Jr. concurred and signed on the 2022 resolution on July 14, 2022.</p>



<p>In both resolutions, the DENR Central Visayas directors were each indicated as the PAMB Chairman.</p>



<p>The Tagbilaran Baywatch insisted that there should be a payment of damages to the owner of Captain’s Peak Resort by the government or erring government officials for losses suffered by the resort owner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These officials allowed the owner to construct and operate the resort which turned out to be illegal,” their position paper read. </p>

2628223,supreme-court-allows-un-rapporteur-khan-submit-opinion-maria-ressa-cyber-libel-appeal,SC allows UN rapporteur Khan to submit opinion in Ressa&#8217;s libel appeal,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – The Supreme Court (SC) allowed a United Nations special rapporteur to submit her opinion in the cyber libel case appeal of Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. </p>



<p>In a resolution dated January 24, 2024, the SC&#8217;s First Division granted the motion of Irene Khan, UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and of Expression, to appear as <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/jardeleza-advises-supreme-court-junk-anti-terror-law-petitions-legal-standing/"">amicus curiae (friend of the court) or chosen expert</a> in the case. The High Court also admitted and noted Khan&#8217;s amicus brief for the case.  </p>



<p>Khan’s brief will provide the SC “the international and regional legal standards as they apply to freedom of expression, especially regarding its application to the law of defamation.” An amicus brief is submitted to a court to help it decide on a specific case.</p>



<p>Aside from Khan, the High Court also allowed the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute to file their opinion in the case.</p>



<p>In June 2023, Khan <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/united-nations-rapporteur-seeks-provide-insights-maria-ressa-pending-libel-case/"">asked</a> the SC to allow her to sit as an expert in the pending libel case of Ressa and former Rappler researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. The UN special rapporteur, in explaining the filing of her motion, earlier explained that she was &#8220;concerned” that the law in the country fails to adequately protect the right to freedom of expression under article 19 of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-human-rights-work/monitoring-and-promoting-un-treaties/international-covenant-civil-and#:~:text=ICCPR%20is%20an%20international%20human,or%20degrading%20treatment%20or%20punishment"">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>. The Philippines is a state party in the said covenant.</p>



<p>Khan noted that the cybercrime law in the Philippines &#8220;raises serious concerns that it limits the ability of journalists to expose, document and address issues of important public interest, thereby violating the right to receive and impart information.”</p>



<p>Almost four years ago, in 2020, a Manila court <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/263790-maria-ressa-reynaldo-santos-jr-convicted-cyber-libel-case-june-15-2020/"">convicted</a> Ressa and Santos of cyber libel over the case filed by businessman Wilfredo Keng. In 2022, the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/court-appeals-affirms-maria-ressa-reynaldo-santos-jr-cyber-libel-possible-jail-sentence/"">Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed</a> the convictions of Ressa and Santos, and imposed a longer prison sentence. </p>



<p>The CA later&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/court-appeals-denies-maria-ressa-appeal-cyber-libel-case/"">junked the motion for reconsideration</a>&nbsp;filed by Ressa in October 2022, which pushed the camp of Ressa and Santos to elevate the case to the High Court. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-why-this-matters"">Why this matters</h5>



<p>Amici curiae are usually invited by the court in constitutional cases to weigh in and give their insights. In Khan and the IBA’s case, they volunteered to provide their opinions in the appeal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Ressa and Santos’ case was still in the lower court, then-special rapporteur on the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression David Kaye also submitted an amicus brief to the court. Kaye said the brief sought to “provide the Honorable Court with a greater understanding of the role of journalists and the special protection all Member States must accord.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Khan is an important figure in the rights of expression and of the press.

In a resolution dated January 24, 2024, the SC's First Division granted the motion of Irene Khan, UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and of Expression, to appear as  amicus curiae (friend of the court) or chosen expert  in the case. The High Court also admitted and noted Khan's amicus brief for the case.        Khan's brief will provide the SC ""the international and regional legal standards as they apply to freedom of expression, especially regarding its application to the law of defamation."" An amicus brief is submitted to a court to help it decide on a specific case.      Aside from Khan, the High Court also allowed the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute to file their opinion in the case.      In June 2023, Khan  asked  the SC to allow her to sit as an expert in the pending libel case of Ressa and former Rappler researcher Reynaldo Santos Jr. The UN special rapporteur, in explaining the filing of her motion, earlier explained that she was ""concerned"" that the law in the country fails to adequately protect the right to freedom of expression under article 19 of the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . The Philippines is a state party in the said covenant.      Khan noted that the cybercrime law in the Philippines ""raises serious concerns that it limits the ability of journalists to expose, document and address issues of important public interest, thereby violating the right to receive and impart information.""      Almost four years ago, in 2020, a Manila court  convicted  Ressa and Santos of cyber libel over the case filed by businessman Wilfredo Keng. In 2022, the  Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed  the convictions of Ressa and Santos, and imposed a longer prison sentence.       The CA later  junked the motion for reconsideration  filed by Ressa in October 2022, which pushed the camp of Ressa and Santos to elevate the case to the High Court.       Why this matters      Amici curiae are usually invited by the court in constitutional cases to weigh in and give their insights. In Khan and the IBA's case, they volunteered to provide their opinions in the appeal.       When Ressa and Santos' case was still in the lower court, then-special rapporteur on the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression David Kaye also submitted an amicus brief to the court. Kaye said the brief sought to ""provide the Honorable Court with a greater understanding of the role of journalists and the special protection all Member States must accord.""       Khan is an important figure in the rights of expression and of the press. As a rapporteur appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, she had been tasked to gather relevant information in relation to alleged violations of right to freedom of opinion and expression. She can also provide recommendations and suggestions to better promote and protect the right to freedom of expression.      Earlier this year, Khan  visited  the Philippines and later released her observations and recommendations. She suggested the  abolition  of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, and also warned that the state of free speech will  affect  the Philippines' standing in the United Nations.  Khan added that efforts of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security,  government's task force on media security, were  lacking . -  Rappler.com   ",Neutral

<p>The parking fee is also only P30 a day, unlike many malls near train stations in Mandaluyong City, Pasig City, Makati City where the minimum is P50 daily or parking is metered.&nbsp;In Quezon City, Ayala&#8217;s Trinoma Mall, however, commuters can park and ride the MRT-3 for P50 on weekdays. </p>



<p>To make it easier for those who park and take the train, RLC has built The Link, a 4,000-square-meter enclosed passageway that lets people who park their cars or motorcycles in Robinsons Metro East and walk comfortably for around 200 meters to the LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig Station.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robinsons Metro East has over 1,500 parking spaces for cars and motorcycles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Link eliminates the need for train riders to leave the train station by going down to the street and then walking long distances to be able to do their shopping.&nbsp; For those with cars, they could just park their vehicles at the mall and take advantage of the rail services to not only save time, energy, and resources but also contribute to reducing road congestion and carbon emissions,&#8221; RLC said. </p>



<p>Hernando Cabrera, LRTA administrator, said their collaboration with RLC “sets a positive precedent for future partnerships” on the projects that “prioritize the comfort and accessibility of Filipino commuters.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The project aligns with Robinsons Land’s commitment to facilitating efficient transportation,” said Joel Lumanlan, RLC vice president for operations and marketing during the signing. </p>



<p>RLC told Rappler in an email that The Link has perked up business in its five-level Robinsons Metro East.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Link generated an uptake in foot traffic for the mall, with notable increases among students and families,” RLC said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the mall is already 23 years old, mall activity had not grown and foot traffic may have plateaued or even fallen, especially with the rise of new malls in the area such as Ayala Feliz just half-a-kilometer away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pasig City Hall Annex 2, a business one-stop shop, also opened in Robinsons Metro East on July 7, 2023. It serves Pasig residents who live in barangays like Dela Paz in Antipolo City, and in Santolan and Manggahan in Pasig that are far from the city’s main offices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto had said during the opening in July that the new annex seeks to improve customer satisfaction of the city’s taxpayers, noting that business taxes make up half of the city’s revenues.&nbsp;People can go there for business registration, tax assessment and payment, and regulatory permit applications. </p>

<p>LRT-2 is a 13.8-kilometer transit line that links the city of Manila from Recto all the way to Marikina City. In 2021, two new stations – Marikina-Pasig Station and Antipolo City Station – were opened with the addition of four more kilometers of railway lines that extended LRT-2 to Masinag, Antipolo City. </p>

To make it easier for those who park and take the train, RLC has built The Link, a 4,000-square-meter enclosed passageway that lets people who park their cars or motorcycles in Robinsons Metro East and walk comfortably for around 200 meters to the LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig Station.               ""The Link takes inspiration from Hong Kong and its malls that are connected directly to the MTR in most districts, as well as London's Hop-on Hop-off experience by bus,"" RLC said.               Robinsons Metro East has over 1,500 parking spaces for cars and motorcycles.       ""The Link eliminates the need for train riders to leave the train station by going down to the street and then walking long distances to be able to do their shopping.  For those with cars, they could just park their vehicles at the mall and take advantage of the rail services to not only save time, energy, and resources but also contribute to reducing road congestion and carbon emissions,"" RLC said.       Hernando Cabrera, LRTA administrator, said their collaboration with RLC ""sets a positive precedent for future partnerships"" on the projects that ""prioritize the comfort and accessibility of Filipino commuters.""       ""The project aligns with Robinsons Land's commitment to facilitating efficient transportation,"" said Joel Lumanlan, RLC vice president for operations and marketing during the signing.       RLC told Rappler in an email that The Link has perked up business in its five-level Robinsons Metro East.       ""The Link generated an uptake in foot traffic for the mall, with notable increases among students and families,"" RLC said.       Since the mall is already 23 years old, mall activity had not grown and foot traffic may have plateaued or even fallen, especially with the rise of new malls in the area such as Ayala Feliz just half-a-kilometer away.         MINI-PARK. Children and adults enjoy a mini-indoor park in The Link, a Hong Kong-inspired interconnection access that makes it easier for people to walk to Robinsons Metro East from the LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig Station (and vice-versa) in Pasig City, on March 16, 2024.        When Rappler visited Robinsons Metro East on March 16, there were significantly more mallgoers due to the improved LRT-2 access, plus the opening of new stores such as Taiwanese restaurant Ersao and a mini-indoor park in the entrance to Robinsons Metro East.         FOOD. Taiwanese restaurant Ersao is now open at The Link, a 4,000-square-meter interconnection access at Robinsons Metro East that links to LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig Station in Marcos Highway, Pasig City, in this photo taken on March 16, 2024. Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler       The Pasig City Hall Annex 2, a business one-stop shop, also opened in Robinsons Metro East on July 7, 2023. It serves Pasig residents who live in barangays like Dela Paz in Antipolo City, and in Santolan and Manggahan in Pasig that are far from the city's main offices.       Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto had said during the opening in July that the new annex seeks to improve customer satisfaction of the city's taxpayers, noting that business taxes make up half of the city's revenues. People can go there for business registration, tax assessment and payment, and regulatory permit applications.       Kid's entertainment establishment Jolly Land opened its largest indoor playground in east of Metro Manila last year in time for the Christmas season.               There's also a new Robinson's Easymart grocery near The Link for commuters who need to buy basic items quickly.       Among the other relatively new food stores in Robinsons Metro East are: Chimmy Yoghurt, Birria, and Tang Fruits.               There's also a Metro East Studio, a large space for dance classes or practices, fan meet-ups, workshops, yoga, ballet, band practices, and musical performances.       LRT-2 is a 13.8-kilometer transit line that links the city of Manila from Recto all the way to Marikina City. In 2021, two new stations - Marikina-Pasig Station and Antipolo City Station - were opened with the addition of four more kilometers of railway lines that extended LRT-2 to Masinag, Antipolo City.       Sta. Lucia link      RLC's The Link adds to the earlier passageway that makes it easier for commuters to go to Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall. Although Sta. Lucia East Mall is just beside Robinsons Metro East in Pasig City, it is officially part of Cainta, Rizal.         WELCOME. Commuters walk towards the entrance to the passageway to Sta. Lucia East Mall from LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig Station along Marcos Highway on March 16, 2024. Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler        The LRTA signed this similar agreement last October 2023 with Sta. Lucia Land Incorporated (SLLI) on the new interconnection access facility between the LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig Station to the Sta. Lucia East Mall.         CLEAN. Commuters walk through a brightly lit passageway at Sta. Lucia in Cainta, Rizal which leads to the LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig Station at the corner of Marcos Highway, on March 16, 2024. Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler         Sta. Lucia Land had granted a portion of its property to LRTA that was needed to construct the link to the LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig station. The LRTA then built the passageway that links the train station to Sta. Lucia East Mall.       Transportation Assistant Secretary for Railways Jorjette Aquino, LRTA administrator Cabrera, and SLLI President Exequiel Robles signed the memorandum of agreement to formalize the collaboration for the facility.       Aquino said ""the concept of the interconnection access is actually more than just infrastructure. It's about promoting connectivity, collaboration and accessibility for the LRT line.""       She said the collaboration showcases the ""partnership between the government and private sector in providing better services for the commuting public.""       Sta. Lucia East Mall has 1,400 parking lots for cars, motorcycles, and bicycles.         TIANGGE. Commercial activity picks up in Sta. Lucia East Mall in Cainta, Rizal, as new interconnection access to the LRT-2 Marikina-Pasig Station leads to higher foot traffic. Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler        The new passenger link has also improved commercial activity in Sta. Lucia East Mall, especially with new stores in the entrance area to the mall such as the Taytay Mega Tiangge shown in the photo above.       In more developed countries and territories with good train systems, moving from one station to another in major points is made easier with clean, well-lit passageways.         TYPICAL. A common scene in Japan's underground passageways where commuters comfortably transfer from one train station to another, in this photo taken on September 25, 2023. Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler       Property owners can also recoup their investments in these access points by leasing parts of the spaces to commercial establishments. -  Rappler.com    ",Neutral
2628144,manila-summons-questions-beijing-sincere-promoting-promoting-south-china-sea,Manila asks Beijing: Are you sincere in promoting South China Sea peace?,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines on Monday, March 25, questioned if China was sincere in “lowering the tensions and promoting peace and stability in the South China Sea” as it protested yet another case of harassment by the China Coast Guard (CCG) and Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM) during a mission to bring soldiers and supplies to a military outpost in Ayungin Shoal.</p>



<p>“China’s aggressive actions call into question its sincerity in lowering the tensions and promoting peace and stability in the South China Sea. Even as the Philippines continues to engage China in dialogue and diplomacy at the bilateral and multilateral levels, China’s aggressive actions contradict and put to waste ASEAN-China efforts to promote practical activities to foster peace and cooperation in the region,” said Department of Foreign affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza, in a statement released to media.</p>



<p>On March 23, CCG and CMM ships harassed, shadowed, and used water cannons against Philippine ships on a mission to bring supplies and soldiers to the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War II ship purposefully run aground in 1999 to serve as an outpost in the area.</p>



<p>A wooden ship contracted by the military to bring supplies, the Unaizah May 4, was hit by the CCG&#8217;s water cannons as it tried to approach the shoal. Philippine officials said Navy personnel were also injured during the mission.</p>



<p>Manila summoned on Monday morning the Chinese embassy’s Charge d’affaires Zhou Zhiyong “to convey the Philippines’ strong protest against the aggressive actions undertaken by the China Coast Guard and Chinese Maritime Militia” during the March 23 mission.</p>



<p>The Philippines’ embassy in Beijing has been instructed to file the same protest before the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-follow-international-law"">Follow international law</h5>



<p>“In these demarches, the Philippines stressed, among others, that China has no right to be in Ayungin Shoal, a low-tide elevation that lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone and continental shelf in accordance with the 1982 UNCLOS and as affirmed by the 2016 Arbitral Award,” said Daza.</p>



<p>UNCLOS is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, while the 2016 Arbitral Award is a ruling that stemmed from the Philippines taking China to court. According to the ruling, Beijing’s sweeping claim of the South China Sea, including parts of the West Philippine Sea, is invalid.</p>



<p>China has refused to recognize the ruling and has insisted that Ayungin Shoal or Second Thomas Shoal, a feature located just over 100 nautical miles off the coast of Palawan, is theirs.</p>



<p>“China’s continued interference with the Philippines’ routine and lawful activities in its own exclusive economic zone is unacceptable. It infringes upon the Philippines’ sovereign rights and jurisdiction.The Philippines demands that Chinese vessels leave the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal and the Philippine exclusive economic zone immediately,” said Daza.</p>



<p>The DFA spokesperson added: “The Philippines urges China to take the correct track of abiding by international law and respecting the legitimate rights of other states like the Philippines, and to cease and desist from its continued violation of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Award.”</p>



<p>In a separate statement released&nbsp;also on Monday, the DFA said that aside from the summon in Manila and the demarche in Beijing, Undersecretary for Bilateral Relations and ASEAN Affairs Ma. Theresa P. Lazaro also spoke to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong to relay Manila&#8217;s &#8220;strongest protest against the aggressive actions undertaken by the China Coast Guard and Chinese Maritime Militia&#8221; during the resupply mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the DFA, the Philippines has lodged 14 protests against China in 2024 alone as of March 25. Since Marcos came into power, the Philippines has lodged 147 protests or notes verbales against China.  </p>



<p>During the March 23 mission, Philippine vessels – the Unaizah May 4 and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)’s BRP Cabra – were subjected to dangerous maneuvers and blocking attempts by Chinese ships. At one point, a CCG ship sailed in reverse in one attempt to block the Unaizah May 4.</p>



<p>While the wooden ship was unable to make it to the Sierra Madre itself, the Philippines was still able to bring soldiers and “essential supplies” to its makeshift outpost through rubber boats. This is the second time in March 2024 alone that China used water cannons in an attempt to stop the Philippines from its mission to Ayungin.</p>



<p>In early March, the Unaizah May 4’s windshield was <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/collision-china-ayungin-shoal-causes-damage-coast-guard-ship/"">shattered from the impact of two CCG water cannons</a>.</p>



<p>Previous resupply missions have been just as fraught. Aside from dangerous maneuvers, shadowing, and water cannon use, collisions have occurred between China and the Philippines in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal.</p>



<p>On March 23, hours after the mission, China’s foreign ministry told the Philippines that it “should be prepared to bear all potential consequences” if it “insists on going its own way” in the South China Sea. Foreign governments issued statements in support of the Philippines, calling out China for its “dangerous” behavior at sea.</p>



<p>Under the Marcos administration, Manila has taken a stronger stance on China’s encroachment of the West Philippine Sea. China has bristled over the government’s approach, berating both Manila and its allies – the United States, especially – of supposedly “stirring up trouble” in the South China Sea.</p>



<p>The March 23 resupply took place just days after Washington announced that US President Joe Biden would be hosting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in the White House for the first-ever <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/trilateral-summit-marcos-biden-kishida-white-house-april-2024/"">US-Japan-PH summit</a>. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>The COBI notices have caused alarm in the city in that they threaten to cut off about half of the water supply which COWD distributes in the city.</p>



<p>Young said the COWD asked COBI not to discontinue the supply of bulk water and instead go to court for them to determine if the water district really needed to pay the disputed debt.</p>



<p>He pointed out that the COWD is a government-owned and -controlled corporation, subject to state auditing rules and which cannot just decide to release funds for a debt that has not been acknowledged.</p>



<p>The disputed debt represents the accumulated difference of a rate increase from P16.60 per cubic meter to P20.57 which COBI implemented in 2021. Last January, COBI increased the rates again to P24.19 per cubic meter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COWD has rejected the price increases as it invoked a force majeure clause in its 2017 contract with COBI, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the contract, COBI can make rate adjustments every three years from 2017.</p>



<p>“[If] there’s a court order, our office will be compelled to pay. That would be our legal basis,” Young told Rappler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said the COWD releasing payments for the disputed debt would likely lead to notices of disallowances from the Commission on Audit (COA).</p>



<p>COBI warned that unless COWD settled its obligations, it would be forced to resort to “legal and contractual remedies.”</p>



<p>COBI legal counsel Roberto Rodrigo, however, said that a water supply disconnection would be the bulk water supplier’s last resort.</p>



<p>Rodrigo said COBI would not go to court yet and would bring the matter to the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) which approved the 2017 contract, the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA), or the COA.</p>



<p>“We are still studying what’s the best angle, and we have to do our research,” Rodrigo said.,</p>



<p>He said COBI was hoping to receive a response from any of the government agencies before the April 12 deadline.</p>



<p>Rodrigo noted that the decision for the COWD not to acknowledge the rate adjustments boiled down to a resolution that was passed by the water district’s board of directors in 2021.</p>



<p>The resolution contains the invocation of the force majeure clause and the decision not to acknowledge the rate adjustment.</p>



<p>Rodrigo maintained that the COWD should start acknowledging the rate adjustments so it could pay up, a matter which Young said was not possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s only possible if there’s a legal basis to acknowledge the debt. The [COWD] board approved the contract of COBI way back through a board resolution. So, in other words, they could also be disapproved now through a board resolution,” Young said.</p>



<p>Young said the COWD also <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/changes-sought-cagayan-de-oro-water-deal-pangilinan-group/"">proposed amendments to the 2017 COWD-COBI contract</a>, including the provision that allows the bulk water supplier to make rate adjustments every three years. COBI representatives, however, said they would need to study the provisions that COWD requested to change and their possible impact on their business.</p>



<p>“For us, it’s not a good practice if you keep changing the provisions in the agreement,” Rodrigo said. – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

Pangilinan's Metro Pacific Investments Corporation, has given COWD  notices of disconnection as it demanded payment of the debt  which the water district did not acknowledge. COBI extended the deadline from March 31 to April 12.                       Must Read                          Cagayan de Oro leaks cost water district over P700 million in 2022 alone                                                                                         The COBI notices have caused alarm in the city in that they threaten to cut off about half of the water supply which COWD distributes in the city.      Young said the COWD asked COBI not to discontinue the supply of bulk water and instead go to court for them to determine if the water district really needed to pay the disputed debt.      He pointed out that the COWD is a government-owned and -controlled corporation, subject to state auditing rules and which cannot just decide to release funds for a debt that has not been acknowledged.      The disputed debt represents the accumulated difference of a rate increase from P16.60 per cubic meter to P20.57 which COBI implemented in 2021. Last January, COBI increased the rates again to P24.19 per cubic meter.       COWD has rejected the price increases as it invoked a force majeure clause in its 2017 contract with COBI, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the contract, COBI can make rate adjustments every three years from 2017.      ""[If] there's a court order, our office will be compelled to pay. That would be our legal basis,"" Young told Rappler.       He said the COWD releasing payments for the disputed debt would likely lead to notices of disallowances from the Commission on Audit (COA).      COBI warned that unless COWD settled its obligations, it would be forced to resort to ""legal and contractual remedies.""      COBI legal counsel Roberto Rodrigo, however, said that a water supply disconnection would be the bulk water supplier's last resort.      Rodrigo said COBI would not go to court yet and would bring the matter to the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) which approved the 2017 contract, the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA), or the COA.      ""We are still studying what's the best angle, and we have to do our research,"" Rodrigo said.,      He said COBI was hoping to receive a response from any of the government agencies before the April 12 deadline.      Rodrigo noted that the decision for the COWD not to acknowledge the rate adjustments boiled down to a resolution that was passed by the water district's board of directors in 2021.      The resolution contains the invocation of the force majeure clause and the decision not to acknowledge the rate adjustment.      Rodrigo maintained that the COWD should start acknowledging the rate adjustments so it could pay up, a matter which Young said was not possible.       ""It's only possible if there's a legal basis to acknowledge the debt. The [COWD] board approved the contract of COBI way back through a board resolution. So, in other words, they could also be disapproved now through a board resolution,"" Young said.      Young said the COWD also  proposed amendments to the 2017 COWD-COBI contract , including the provision that allows the bulk water supplier to make rate adjustments every three years. COBI representatives, however, said they would need to study the provisions that COWD requested to change and their possible impact on their business.      ""For us, it's not a good practice if you keep changing the provisions in the agreement,"" Rodrigo said. -  Rappler.com   ",Neutral

<p>CAIRO, Egypt – Israeli forces besieged two more Gaza hospitals on Sunday, March 24, pinning down medical teams under heavy gunfire, the Palestinian Red Crescent said, and Israel said it had captured 480 militants in continued clashes at Gaza&#8217;s main Al Shifa hospital.</p>



<p>Israel says hospitals in the Palestinian enclave, where war has been raging for over five months, are used by Hamas militants as bases. It has released videos and pictures supporting the claim.</p>



<p>Hamas and medical staff deny the accusations.</p>



<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said one of its staff was killed when Israeli tanks suddenly pushed back into areas around Al-Amal and Nasser hospitals in the southern city of Khan Younis, amid heavy bombardment and gunfire.</p>



<p>Israeli forces began operating around Al-Amal, the military said, following &#8220;precise intelligence … which indicated that terrorists are using civilian infrastructure for terror activities in the area of Al-Amal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Israeli armored forces sealed off Al-Amal Hospital and carried out extensive bulldozing operations in its vicinity, the Red Crescent said in a statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;All of our teams are in extreme danger at the moment and are completely immobilised,&#8221; it said.</p>



<p>The Red Crescent said Israeli forces were now demanding the complete evacuation of staff, patients and displaced people from Al Amal&#8217;s premises and were firing smoke bombs into the area to force out its occupants.</p>



<p>A displaced Palestinian was killed inside the hospital compound after being hit in the head by Israeli fire, the Red Crescent said in a later update.</p>



<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said dozens of patients and medical staffers had been detained by Israeli forces at Al Shifa in Gaza City in the enclave&#8217;s north that has been under Israeli control for a week.</p>



<p>The Hamas-run government media office said Israeli forces had killed five Palestinian doctors during their seven-day-old swoop on Al Shifa.</p>



<p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that report. It said earlier that it had killed over 170 gunmen in the raid, which the Palestinian Health Ministry said had also caused the deaths of five patients.</p>



<p>Al Shifa is one of the few healthcare facilities even partially operational in north Gaza, and – like others – had also been housing some of the nearly 2 million civilians – over 80% of Gaza&#8217;s population – displaced by the war.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right now, Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists are barricading themselves inside Shifa hospital wards,&#8221; said Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.</p>



<p>Hagari said Hamas gunmen were firing at soldiers from inside the emergency and maternity wards of the hospital, and also firing mortars at troops in the hospital, causing damage.</p>



<p>The Hamas-run government media office said they &#8220;categorically refute this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How can they claim this while their soldiers roam and frolic inside the complex with ease, conducting interrogations with displaced persons, patients, and the wounded,&#8221; said media office director Ismail Al-Thawabta.</p>

2627958,commission-audit-orders-heart-center-pay-suppliers-compensation-claims-march-2024,COA orders PH Heart Center to settle suppliers’ claims worth P20 million,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Audit (COA) told the Philippine Heart Center (PHC) it should pay two suppliers a combined amount of more than P20 million for the services they rendered. </p>



<p>Separate decisions from the COA en banc said that even without a formal contract, Lifelink, Inc. and RG Meditron, Inc. are entitled to payments for delivering various medical supplies to PHC on a consignment basis.</p>



<p>Under the consignment scheme between Lifelink and PHC from 2017 to 2020, the private company sent items to the state-run hospital, which in turn sold the goods at a 10% markup. The arrangement was for PHC to remit the proceeds of the sale to Lifelink, minus the 10% margin. </p>



<p>In its petition, Lifelink said PHC did not remit the proceeds of the sale to Lifelink, even though the government facility sold products worth P10.27 million, based on sales invoices, delivery receipts, utilization reports, justifications and affidavit of merit signed by doctors. </p>



<p>Meditron, meanwhile, delivered vascular products and pacemakers to the hospital for standby use, from 2017 to 2021. </p>



<p>After a patient uses an item, the hospital notifies the supplier, which subsequently issues a sales invoice that is countersigned by the PHC. Meditron then issues a billing notice to PHC, requesting that the payment be released.</p>



<p>The company, however, said PHC did not settle its claims worth P9.936 million despite written demands.</p>



<p>In separate decisions, state auditors ruled that the state-run hospital is obligated to pay its suppliers.</p>



<p>The challenge in both cases is calculating the amount that the hospital owes the suppliers. This is because the money was co-mingled with the PHC&#8217;s General Fund, and not specified in a separate account book. </p>



<p>The COA, however, insisted that these roadblocks do not invalidate the consignors&#8217; claim. </p>



<p>“Although the deliveries were not supported with a valid and existing [consignment agreement], this Commission finds that Meditron should be compensated for the delivered items utilized and paid for by PHC patients,” the first ruling read.</p>



<p>“To avoid unjust enrichment, Lifelink should be compensated based on the principle of quantum meruit,” the second resolution added.</p>



<p>The said principle – which means &#8220;as much as he deserves&#8221; – is applied in the absence of an express agreement on fees, according to the Supreme Court. This allows a person or an entity to recover a reasonable value of the thing he delivered or the service he rendered. <strong>– Rappler.com </strong></p>

2627962,russia-mourns-victims-concert-hall-attack-march-2024,Russia mourns victims of deadly concert hall attack,"
<p>MOSCOW, Russia&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;Russia lowered flags to half-mast on Sunday, March 24, for a day of mourning after scores of people were gunned down with automatic weapons at a rock concert outside Moscow in the&nbsp;deadliest attack&nbsp;inside Russia for two decades.</p>



<p>President&nbsp;Vladimir Putin&nbsp;declared a national day of mourning after pledging to track down and punish all those behind the attack, in which 133 people were killed, including three children, and more than 150 injured.</p>



<p>&#8220;I express my deep, sincere condolences to all those who lost their loved ones,&#8221; Putin said in an address to the nation on Saturday, his first public comments on the attack. &#8220;The whole country and our entire people are grieving with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Islamic State&nbsp;claimed responsibility for Friday&#8217;s attack, but Putin has not publicly mentioned the Islamist militant group in connection with the attackers, who he said had been trying to escape to&nbsp;Ukraine. He asserted that some on &#8220;the Ukrainian side&#8221; had prepared to spirit them across the border.</p>



<p>Ukraine has repeatedly&nbsp;denied any role&nbsp;in the attack, which Putin also blamed on &#8220;international terrorism&#8221;.</p>



<p>People laid flowers at&nbsp;Crocus City Hall, the 6,200-seat concert hall outside Moscow where&nbsp;four armed men&nbsp;burst in on Friday just before Soviet-era rock group Picnic was to perform its hit &#8220;Afraid of Nothing&#8221;.</p>



<p>The men fired their automatic weapons in short bursts at terrified civilians who fell screaming in a hail of bullets.</p>



<p>It was the deadliest attack on Russian territory since the 2004&nbsp;Beslan school siege, when Islamist militants took more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children, hostage.</p>



<p>Long lines formed in Moscow to donate blood. Blood banks said on Sunday they now had enough blood supplies for four to six months.</p>



<p>Across Moscow, billboards carried a picture of a single candle, the date of the attack and the words &#8220;We mourn&#8221;. In other cities, people laid flowers.</p>



<p>Countries around the world have expressed horror at the attack and&nbsp;sent their condolences&nbsp;to the Russian people.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-gunmen"">Gunmen</h5>



<p>Putin said 11 people had been detained, including the four gunmen, who fled the concert hall and made their way to the Bryansk region, about 340 km (210 miles) southwest of Moscow.</p>



<p>&#8220;They tried to hide and moved towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border,&#8221; Putin said.</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s Federal Security Service (FSB) said the gunmen had contacts in Ukraine and were captured near the border.</p>



<p>The suspects have been brought to Moscow and may appear in court later in the day, according to local news agencies.</p>



<p>Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, triggering a major European war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other.</p>



<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was typical of Putin and &#8220;other thugs&#8221; to seek to divert blame.</p>



<p>Islamic State, the Islamist group that once sought control over swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group&#8217;s Amaq agency said on Telegram. On Saturday night, Islamic State released on its Telegram channels what it said was&nbsp;footage of the attack.</p>



<p>In video footage published by Russian media and Telegram channels with close ties to the Kremlin, one of the suspects said he was offered money to carry out the attack.</p>



<p>&#8220;I shot people,&#8221; the suspect, his hands tied and his hair held by an interrogator, a black boot beneath his chin, said in poor and highly accented Russian.</p>



<p>When asked why, he said: &#8220;For money.&#8221; The man said he had been promised half a million roubles (a little over $5,000). One was shown answering questions through a Tajik translator. Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon spoke to Putin about the attack.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Islamic State</h5>



<p>The White House said the US government shared information with Russia early this month about a planned attack in Moscow, and issued a public advisory to Americans in Russia on March 7. It said Islamic State bore sole responsibility for the attack.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was no Ukrainian involvement whatsoever,&#8221; US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.</p>

President Vladimir Putin declared a national day of mourning after pledging to track down and punish all those behind the attack, in which 133 people were killed, including three children, and more than 150 injured.      ""I express my deep, sincere condolences to all those who lost their loved ones,"" Putin said in an address to the nation on Saturday, his first public comments on the attack. ""The whole country and our entire people are grieving with you.""      Islamic State claimed responsibility for Friday's attack, but Putin has not publicly mentioned the Islamist militant group in connection with the attackers, who he said had been trying to escape to Ukraine. He asserted that some on ""the Ukrainian side"" had prepared to spirit them across the border.      Ukraine has repeatedly denied any role in the attack, which Putin also blamed on ""international terrorism"".      People laid flowers at Crocus City Hall, the 6,200-seat concert hall outside Moscow where four armed men burst in on Friday just before Soviet-era rock group Picnic was to perform its hit ""Afraid of Nothing"".      The men fired their automatic weapons in short bursts at terrified civilians who fell screaming in a hail of bullets.      It was the deadliest attack on Russian territory since the 2004 Beslan school siege, when Islamist militants took more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children, hostage.      Long lines formed in Moscow to donate blood. Blood banks said on Sunday they now had enough blood supplies for four to six months.      Across Moscow, billboards carried a picture of a single candle, the date of the attack and the words ""We mourn"". In other cities, people laid flowers.      Countries around the world have expressed horror at the attack and sent their condolences to the Russian people.      Gunmen      Putin said 11 people had been detained, including the four gunmen, who fled the concert hall and made their way to the Bryansk region, about 340 km (210 miles) southwest of Moscow.      ""They tried to hide and moved towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border,"" Putin said.      Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said the gunmen had contacts in Ukraine and were captured near the border.      The suspects have been brought to Moscow and may appear in court later in the day, according to local news agencies.      Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, triggering a major European war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other.      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was typical of Putin and ""other thugs"" to seek to divert blame.      Islamic State, the Islamist group that once sought control over swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's Amaq agency said on Telegram. On Saturday night, Islamic State released on its Telegram channels what it said was footage of the attack.      In video footage published by Russian media and Telegram channels with close ties to the Kremlin, one of the suspects said he was offered money to carry out the attack.      ""I shot people,"" the suspect, his hands tied and his hair held by an interrogator, a black boot beneath his chin, said in poor and highly accented Russian.      When asked why, he said: ""For money."" The man said he had been promised half a million roubles (a little over $5,000). One was shown answering questions through a Tajik translator. Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon spoke to Putin about the attack.      Islamic State      The White House said the US government shared information with Russia early this month about a planned attack in Moscow, and issued a public advisory to Americans in Russia on March 7. It said Islamic State bore sole responsibility for the attack.      ""There was no Ukrainian involvement whatsoever,"" US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.      Russian officials have bristled at the U.S. public comments on the attack and say Russian investigators must be allowed to make their own findings.      The United States and other Western countries whose relations with Moscow have been fraught over the Ukraine war have also sent messages of condolence to the Russian people.

2627659,opinion-urgent-appeal-amend-gcta-law,[OPINION] An urgent appeal to amend the GCTA law,"
<p>The Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) Law, enacted through Republic Act 10592 in 2013, aimed to promote the rehabilitation of Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) by reducing their length of stay if they manifest good behavior while serving their prison sentence. It also was envisioned by Congress to be a mechanism to lessen prison congestion and to reduce the cost of running prisons.</p>



<p>Given the state of prison conditions in the Philippines in 2013, where it was characterized by prison crowding, long prison sentences even for low level drug users, lack of resources and personnel&#8211; and the ensuing reliance on the&nbsp;<em>pangkat</em>&nbsp;(gang) and&nbsp;<em>mayores</em>&nbsp;(inmate leadership) to keep the system afloat, this law was indeed envisioned to be revolutionary.</p>



<p>More than a decade after the passage of the law, we should have now reaped the benefits – more reformed PDLs, less crowding, less prison violence, and more efficient jail and prison systems.</p>



<p>Yet, these targeted outcomes have not yet been realized. Our prison system has, in fact, become <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-drug-arrest-jail-prison-congestion-search-alternatives/"">more congested than ever</a>. And running our prisons and jails have become costlier. This is made worse by the lingering effects of the War on Drugs implemented by the previous president, where 70 percent of the PDLs are serving time for drug offenses, many of whom are in for life imprisonment.</p>



<p>While there are many organizational and cultural factors that limited the full potential of the GCTA law, one simple yet glaring reason was how the law was worded. It lacked specificity. </p>



<p>The law says, &#8220;Art. 99. Who grants time allowances. – Whenever lawfully justified, the Director of the Bureau of Corrections, the Chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology and/or the Warden of a provincial, district, municipal or city jail shall grant allowance for good conduct.&#8221;</p>



<p>The law did not include Prison Superintendents of the seven prison facilities of the Bureau of Corrections, including&nbsp; the biggest mega prison complex in the world, the New Bilibid Prison.&nbsp; This is a very unfortunate omission considering that the GCTA law is specially designed for convicted prisoners. While convicted prisoners can avail of the GCTA, it will be only through the Director General of the Bureau of Corrections, which at the current situation of having 50,000 PDLs nationwide, becomes an overwhelming task for the office.</p>



<p>Additionally, while Wardens of the BJMP jails, like municipal jails with inmates of less than 100, and where the Warden has a rank of a Senior Jail Officer 1 (SJO1) who is a sergeant, can grant GCTA credits, the Superintendent in the New Bilibid Prisons, with a PDL population of almost 30,000 and with a rank of at least a colonel,&nbsp;CANNOT&nbsp;grant a GCTA.</p>



<p>The lack of power to grant GCTA among the Prison Superintendents has delayed the granting of GCTA to truly deserving PDLs. It has affected and continues to affect 50,000 PDLs nationwide.</p>



<p>Interviews with legislative staff who crafted this law said that this was due to apprehensions that BuCor officials may abuse their authority. In 2013, the BuCor was plagued with issues of drug dealing, gang violence and contraband proliferation and Congress limited the granting of GCTA to the BuCor Director General. Indeed, in 2019, the &#8220;GCTA for sale&#8221; controversy erupted when former Calauan, Laguna Mayor Antonio Sanchez was released early. While the subsequent Congressional Inquiry did not find any anomalous actions by the BuCor officials, it nevertheless created an impression that BuCor personnel were easily corrupted by the power to grant early releases.</p>



<p>The current BuCor leadership is trying its very best to expedite the grant of the GCTA by forming multiple committees that assess the behavior of the PDLs. And the Director General had instituted many organizational and cultural reforms to streamline and legitimize the awarding of the GCTA. There are checks and balances introduced to make the granting of GCTA transparent and corrupt-free.</p>



<p>Still, the process would be expedited if the GCTA law is amended. It should be a simple tweak. </p>



<p>It must read, &#8220;Art. 99. Who grants time allowances. – Whenever lawfully justified, the Director of the Bureau of Corrections, the Chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology and/or the SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PRISON AND PENAL FARMS, Warden of a provincial, district, municipal or city jail shall grant allowance for good conduct.&#8221;</p>



<p>If this amendment is made, I estimate that at least 1,000 behaving inmates will be released early by at least a year. This will translate to government savings of at least P25 million a year. This savings should be enough to construct new schools annually. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

2626622,opinion-ensuring-healthcare-access-poor-philippines,[OPINION] Beyond infrastructure: Ensuring healthcare access for the poor,"
<p>The Department of Health (DOH)’s announcement in the 2nd National Health Sector Meeting to build 28 primary care facilities by 2028 under the Bagong Urgent Care and Ambulatory Services (BUCAS) has been received with much optimism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BUCAS is envisioned to be operated by the DOH and will serve as an extension of hospitals by providing outpatient consultations, emergency care, laboratory tests, minor surgeries, and free medicine for indigent patients. The DOH anticipates that the primary care benefits package will be under PhilHealth’s responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The initiative, aligned with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) declaration of primary health care as one of the 10 global health threats in 2019, is applauded for its intent to alleviate the strain on public hospitals and enhance healthcare accessibility. Rightfully so, as there is a need to increase the number of quality health facilities in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of the planning for constructing BUCAS facilities from 2024-2028, we offer recommendations to ensure that the infrastructure will address the healthcare needs of the marginalized.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-building-blocks"">Building blocks</h5>



<p><strong><em>Targeting the poor and underprivileged:</em> </strong>The plan targets to create 28 facilities for the 28 million poor Filipinos. However, based on the monthly poverty threshold of P13,797.00 in 2023, the number of poor families is 25.24 million. Thus, indicators to define and identify the 28 million poor Filipinos slated to benefit from these facilities demand precision. Prioritizing regions with the highest poverty incidence and population-to-health center ratio serves as good starting points.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Improving access to affordable medicine: </strong></em>A cohesive healthcare system must also strive to provide affordable medicine in drugstores and pharmacies. Given that the patient journey often does not end in outpatient consultations, diagnosis, and treatment, the proposed BUCAS centers should be linked with means to ensure the affordability of quality medicines not offered in their facilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Addressing the poor’s barriers to healthcare: </strong></em>More importantly, constructing infrastructure requires acknowledging the need for additional healthcare professionals and understanding the poor’s barriers to healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most healthcare professionals in the Philippines are clustered in urban areas or have left the country, leaving fewer professionals where people are poorest. Hence, strategic personnel planning, especially for the underserved areas, and complementing long-term strategies outlined in the DOH Human Resources for Health (HRH) Philippine Master Plan 2020-2040 is necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from this, understanding patterns of health-seeking behavior among the poor is crucial. Factors such as lack of access to information on available health services, absence of time to consult professionals, and reluctance to disclose their health conditions hinder them from consulting healthcare facilities. This calls for health literacy and awareness campaigns and promoting positive perceptions toward seeking primary care among the poor.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-minimizing-risks-maximizing-opportunities"">Minimizing risks, maximizing opportunities</h5>



<p>Currently, the government has identified Tacloban, the Bicol region, and Batangas as possible locations based on the availability of land and the willingness of the local governments. The strategy is to utilize the lands of state universities and colleges and install container vans as temporary care centers while facilities are being constructed. While the availability of land is a necessary criterion, this must be supported with evidence-based initiatives to identify locations where most people could be served. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The DOH&#8217;s Philippine Health Facility Development Plan (PHFDP) mapped and constructed primary care facilities (PCFs) in each province using the following considerations: land and building availability, accessibility to transportation, land topography, access to utilities, level of hazard, and socio-economic situation. Developing similar parameters to better situate BUCAS centers is imperative.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Planning for resilience: </strong></em>Given that the Philippines ranked first in the list of disaster risk countries in 2023, developing resilient health infrastructure should go beyond constructing climate-resilient buildings. Accounting for resilience should consider the capacity of existing health systems to ensure minimal disruption to services, and the accessibility of road and transport networks relative to the population at risk during disaster and conflict.</p>



<p><em><strong>Strengthening local government capacities: </strong></em>We further recommend that the initiative be careful not to undermine the efforts of decentralization. A top-down approach may overlook local context sensitivity and the capacity of local decision-making authorities, potentially leading to services that may not adequately address local health disparities. Establishing primary care facilities should be a collaborative effort between the national and local governments to strengthen the capacity of local health departments and promote an inclusive and tailored approach to healthcare delivery.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Linking with existing health systems:</strong> </em>Currently, recommendations to integrate services of BUCAS with Malasakit Centers, Super Health Centers and Regional Specialty Centers have been put forward by Senator Bong Go. While BUCAS centers are intended to be managed by the DOH, links with existing public hospitals, rural health units, and other healthcare systems should be developed to ensure the continuity of care, enhance referral pathways, and provide comprehensive health services for the patients.</p>



<p><em><strong>Scaling for sustainability: </strong></em>The current plan for constructing BUCAS centers spans five years.

","<p>The plan is to build 28 primary care facilities for 28 million poor Filipinos by 2028</p>
",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-ensuring-healthcare-access-poor-philippines/,2024-03-24T10:00:00,2024-03-25T13:12:20,"[758, 755]",[OPINION] Beyond infrastructure: Ensuring healthcare access for the poor,"  The Department of Health (DOH)'s announcement in the 2nd National Health Sector Meeting to build 28 primary care facilities by 2028 under the Bagong Urgent Care and Ambulatory Services (BUCAS) has been received with much optimism.       BUCAS is envisioned to be operated by the DOH and will serve as an extension of hospitals by providing outpatient consultations, emergency care, laboratory tests, minor surgeries, and free medicine for indigent patients. The DOH anticipates that the primary care benefits package will be under PhilHealth's responsibility.       The initiative, aligned with the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of primary health care as one of the 10 global health threats in 2019, is applauded for its intent to alleviate the strain on public hospitals and enhance healthcare accessibility. Rightfully so, as there is a need to increase the number of quality health facilities in the country.       In light of the planning for constructing BUCAS facilities from 2024-2028, we offer recommendations to ensure that the infrastructure will address the healthcare needs of the marginalized.       Building blocks        Targeting the poor and underprivileged:   The plan targets to create 28 facilities for the 28 million poor Filipinos. However, based on the monthly poverty threshold of P13,797.00 in 2023, the number of poor families is 25.24 million. Thus, indicators to define and identify the 28 million poor Filipinos slated to benefit from these facilities demand precision. Prioritizing regions with the highest poverty incidence and population-to-health center ratio serves as good starting points.         Improving access to affordable medicine:   A cohesive healthcare system must also strive to provide affordable medicine in drugstores and pharmacies. Given that the patient journey often does not end in outpatient consultations, diagnosis, and treatment, the proposed BUCAS centers should be linked with means to ensure the affordability of quality medicines not offered in their facilities.         Addressing the poor's barriers to healthcare:   More importantly, constructing infrastructure requires acknowledging the need for additional healthcare professionals and understanding the poor's barriers to healthcare.       Most healthcare professionals in the Philippines are clustered in urban areas or have left the country, leaving fewer professionals where people are poorest. Hence, strategic personnel planning, especially for the underserved areas, and complementing long-term strategies outlined in the DOH Human Resources for Health (HRH) Philippine Master Plan 2020-2040 is necessary.       Aside from this, understanding patterns of health-seeking behavior among the poor is crucial. Factors such as lack of access to information on available health services, absence of time to consult professionals, and reluctance to disclose their health conditions hinder them from consulting healthcare facilities. This calls for health literacy and awareness campaigns and promoting positive perceptions toward seeking primary care among the poor.       Minimizing risks, maximizing opportunities      Currently, the government has identified Tacloban, the Bicol region, and Batangas as possible locations based on the availability of land and the willingness of the local governments. The strategy is to utilize the lands of state universities and colleges and install container vans as temporary care centers while facilities are being constructed. While the availability of land is a necessary criterion, this must be supported with evidence-based initiatives to identify locations where most people could be served.        The DOH's Philippine Health Facility Development Plan (PHFDP) mapped and constructed primary care facilities (PCFs) in each province using the following considerations: land and building availability, accessibility to transportation, land topography, access to utilities, level of hazard, and socio-economic situation. Developing similar parameters to better situate BUCAS centers is imperative.         Planning for resilience:   Given that the Philippines ranked first in the list of disaster risk countries in 2023, developing resilient health infrastructure should go beyond constructing climate-resilient buildings. Accounting for resilience should consider the capacity of existing health systems to ensure minimal disruption to services, and the accessibility of road and transport networks relative to the population at risk during disaster and conflict.        Strengthening local government capacities:   We further recommend that the initiative be careful not to undermine the efforts of decentralization. A top-down approach may overlook local context sensitivity and the capacity of local decision-making authorities, potentially leading to services that may not adequately address local health disparities. Establishing primary care facilities should be a collaborative effort between the national and local governments to strengthen the capacity of local health departments and promote an inclusive and tailored approach to healthcare delivery.         Linking with existing health systems:   Currently, recommendations to integrate services of BUCAS with Malasakit Centers, Super Health Centers and Regional Specialty Centers have been put forward by Senator Bong Go. While BUCAS centers are intended to be managed by the DOH, links with existing public hospitals, rural health units, and other healthcare systems should be developed to ensure the continuity of care, enhance referral pathways, and provide comprehensive health services for the patients.        Scaling for sustainability:   The current plan for constructing BUCAS centers spans five years. While the objective is not to continuously increase the number of health facilities, scaling similar interventions to address the health needs of the population requires capacitating healthcare personnel, maintaining the infrastructure, and improving collaboration with respective local governments to maximize the use and allocation of resources.       We reiterate that the government's goal to construct additional healthcare facilities is of utmost importance and warrants full attention. After all, the health stations, RHUs, and HCs serve as entry points into the health system.      However, the effectiveness of infrastructure hinges on more than just steel and concrete. Policymakers should prioritize initiatives that strengthen not only infrastructure but also address the underlying barriers to healthcare access for the poor.       More than building structures, we must break down barriers to healthcare access.  - Rappler.com        Kenneth Y.
